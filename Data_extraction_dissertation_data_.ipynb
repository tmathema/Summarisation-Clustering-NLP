              "'<p>Eliada Griffin-EL <p>Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town <p>Accepted: January 2014 <p>JEL: D85, J15, L26, M13 <p>Micro-sized but formally registered businesses  of the South African entrepreneurial landscape  occupy a particular place on the country’s  development agenda. As micro-enterprises,  they face the well-known challenges of  achieving scale and productivity levels; yet, as  formally registered businesses, they serve as a  bridge between the central and peripheral  markets that both constitute the South African  economy. With their failure rates presumed to  be high, yet their success presumed to be  important, understanding how they facilitate  their entrepreneurial process while having  limited capacity becomes a question of both  intrigue and development implications for  economic inclusivity.  <p>The purpose of this study is to explore the <p>structural embeddedness of South African  microbusinesses – and to better understand how  they have engaged with the social relationships  in which they are embedded in order to  advance and support their entrepreneurial  activity. This study is driven by the initial  open-ended research question, “Is there value <p>in microbusinesses’ relationships that enable  them to entrepreneurially function – and even  excel - beyond their resource and capacity  constraints?’ Inspired by assumptions of the  economic sociological literature, the analysis  attempts to visually depict the shape of their  ego-centric networks, in order to convey the  perceptual distance or closeness that they bear  with various entities. Additionally, the study  provides a conceptualisation of the diversity  relational types and entrepreneurial value they  contribute.  <p>Conducted as a comparative grounded <p>theory analysis, data was collected via the in- depth interviews of 30 formally registered  microbusinesses of black South African entre- preneurs from the (clothing) manufacturing (set  I) and service sectors (set II). The study took  place in Greater Johannesburg in partnership  with The Business Place. All firms included/  involved? employed 10 or less employees.  <p>As suggested by findings of the qualitative <p>analysis, the study presents the central  proposition that the innovation process involved  in a microbusiness’s value chain is facilitated  by a high degree of  closeness  with a diverse set  of relationships. Microenterprises in the <p>Abstract <p>clothing manufacturing sector appear to have a  higher degree of closeness with a diverse array  of actors, which enables them to undergo an  interaction-oriented innovation process as a  key part of their entrepreneurial process. The  data did not present similar evidence to suggest  the service microenterprises’ networks support  the same phenomenon. Moreover, the data  emphasises the relational nature of the  innovation processes in design and production  by engaging in a collaborative creation process  with similar and different microbusinesses.  Hence relationships with these individuals tend  to be highly valued and enacted frequently,  facilitating a closeness. Network diversity  structure (NDS), an original core concept of  the emergent theoretical framework, refers to  the degree of closeness, diversity, and number  of relationship types that constitutes the  structural shape of ties. As in the grounded  theory tradition, the discussion explores how  the findings are supported by - and contribute  to - the literature on networks and innovation.  <p>Social  embeddedness  and  social  capital <p>literature suggest that <p>interactions,  and norms inform economic behavior that  shapes the market. In turn<p>entrepreneurs  influence - and are influenced by - their  engagement with the broader society within  which they are embedded (Granovetter, 1985;  Giddens, 1986; Woolcock, 1998; Grootaert,  Narayan, Jones, & Woolcock, 2003; Dobbin,  2004; Urban, 2011). At the core is the  assumption that an economic actor makes his  or her decisions resulting from a negotiation of  their personal utility and the information and  norms they draw from their engagement with  others  (Granovetter,  1985).  The  social <p>embeddedness perspective moves away from  the  individual-  or  organisational-centered <p>outlook of entrepreneurship and provides a  view by which to examine entrepreneurs in  respect to their relational context (Portes &  Sensenbrenner, 1993; Portes, 1998). Network  studies particularly examine “the structure of  the relations between social actors and how  patterns in those relations influence a variety  of outcomes,” (Stuart & Sorenson, 2005:233). <p>Also referred to as a structural analysis,  network studies assist in unveiling the  restrictions and opportunities that an actor  inherits as a result of the relationships they are  embedded within (Garcia, 2006). Hoang and  Antoncic (2003) acknowledge the need for  theory building that captures the nexus  between outcome- and process-oriented studies.  This speaks to the dynamism of networks and  their ability to support a small firm’s evolving  needs (Hite & Hesterly, 2001). It is in this gap  of networks’ role in the entrepreneurial process  that this study hopes to contribute.  <p>This study draws from social capital <p>literature’s broad distinctions across relationship  types. Horizontal relationships – or bonds and  bridges - loosely describe relationships between  entities from close, familial settings and similar  characteristics and relationships between parties  of different circles or communities, respectively  (Gittell & Vidal, 1998; Woolcock & Narayan,  2000). Vertical relationships, termed as linkages,  refer to relationships between entities and  institutions (Woolcock, 1998, 2002). Bonds,  bridges,  and  linkages  will  provide  the <p>conceptual language and theoretical reference  point of the idea of diversity in networks.  <p>Apart from the entrepreneurial process, the <p>empirical arm of the literature tends to focus  on the characteristics influencing, resources  gained from, or the composition of the network  structure. Attributes such as culture (Greve &  Salaff, 2003; Klyver, Hindle, & Meyer, 2008),  economic sector (Spence, Schmidpeter, &  Habisch, 2003), and business phase (Klyver et  al., 2008) of entrepreneurs have been featured.  Size (Barr, 1995; 2002); global exposure  (Mcdade & Spring, 2005); gender (Kuada,  2009; Rutashobya, Allan, & Nilsson, 2009);  one’s ‘identity landscape’ (Pingle, 2001); and  ethnicity (Bruce, 2003) are also highlighted  entrepreneurial attributes that lend to network  structural variation. Broader environmental  factors – such as the degree of regional  development (Garcia, 2006) or economic  liberalisation (Meagher, 2006) – have also  been recognised as a contributing variable.  Resource- based network studies highlight  network gains – such as knowledge acquisition  and production capacities (Yli-Renko, Autio, &  Sapienza, 2001); security (Barr, 1995, 2002);  and innovation aspects (Barr, 1995, 1002; <p>Bakker, Oerlemans, & Pretorius, 2008). Social  arrangements such as familial ties (Luo, 1997;  Fafchamps & Minten, 2002); sub-contracting  ties (Luo, 1997); home-based networks (Zhou,  Wu, & Luo, 2007); and extra-, inter-, and  intra-firm linkages (Yeung, 1997) describe the  network composition that even enable a small  firm’s adjustment to global changes (Chen,  2009; Lu & Beamish, 2001; Yeung, 1997;  Zhou et al., 2007).  <p>Although the literature appears to be <p>growing, there is still much more to learn  about how network structure facilitates the  entrepreneurial process- particularly with small,  emerging firms within African economies  which are increasingly opening and connecting  to a global economy (Naude & Havenga,  2005). Studying the formally registered micro- business community within the backdrop of a  dynamic emerging economy such as South  Africa bears its own distinct significance  (Human, 2009). The relational structures of  such firms embody both formal and informal  ties that span the formal and peripheral  economies. Hence, an inductive, exploratory  approach is applied in order to grasp the  network characteristics that are embedded  within diverse economic domains. <p>Data was analysed using the grounded theory  methodology.  Entrepreneurial  research  in <p>general, as Makela and Turcan (2007) suggest,  has room to be enriched by the capturing of  nuanced factors. Grounded theory analysis,  like most qualitative analyses, guides the  investigator  towards  identifying  abstract <p>themes from the raw data. Grounded theory’s  distinguishing objective is to derive an original  ‘theory’ from the data which conceptually  captures  the  intrinsic  process  of  the <p>phenomenon being studied (Glaser & Strauss,  1967). Beyond the initial phase of thematic  coding, analysis also entails a constant  comparison and categorisation of codes to  gradually reveal the main concepts of the  emerging theory. Upon reaching theoretical  saturation, the central conceptual category is <p>identified to which all other conceptual  categories relate to build an explicatory  narrative of the phenomenon. Propositions can  be formed to be tested in future studies.  (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin,  1990). <p>Data was collected in June to August of 2008  via in-depth, open-ended interviews with thirty  micro-sized South African firms. The sample  was constructed via random selection of  willing, available firms from The Business  Place Opportunity Exchange Database, The  Johannesburg Fashion Week listings, and to a  lesser extent, the snow-balling method via  referrals. ‘Micro’ in this study is defined as  firms hiring ten or less full-time employees.  All the businesses were formally registered in  South Africa and all the entrepreneurs were  black South Africans. Approximately 47 per  cent of the subjects interviewed hired at least  one employee and 30 per cent spoke to having  at least one business partner. The median age  of the business organisations was three years,  ranging from a minimum of 4 months to a  maximum of 12 years. More than 50 per cent  of the entrepreneurs themselves fell within the  ages of 25 and 30, the youngest being 21 and  the oldest more than 50. 47 per cent of  entrepreneurs operated their businesses from  the Central Business District of Johannesburg.  The remaining were based in the broader  Johannesburg metropolitan area consisting of  the surrounding townships, suburbs, and towns  – such as Soweto, Vosloorus, Benoni, Alberton,  and Vereeninging in the Vaal.  <p>The broad spectrum of enterprises of <p>various ages that are featured in the study hold  the commonality of being microenterprises. In  this study, their small scale is primarily  measured in terms of employment, where all  firms have ten or less employees. The broad  spectrum allows for the analysis to identify  patterns common across the relational structure  of micro-enterprises, despite the duration of  time that have been in operation. In this  manner, the variable of size is kept constant.  Extended analysis, as well as literature, does  suggest that the structure of networks for even  small-scale enterprises varies by the age of the  firm. Nonetheless, considered beyond the <p>scope of this study, the analysis focuses upon  cross-cutting network trends across micro- firms of all ages for this phase of the analysis.  <p>Of all the subjects interviewed, data from <p>twenty-four firms was analysed. Exactly half  of the set are from the clothing/fashion  manufacturing industry. The other 50 per cent  was comprised of firms from the service  industries - five construction firms, four media  and publicity firms, and three health and  beauty enterprises. Firms which were self- labeled ‘construction firms’ mostly provided  services of customised renovation and design  services to both private and public property.  Such work is categorised under ‘specialised  consumer discretionary services,’ according to  the Standard and Poor’s Global Industry  Classification Standard, and hence, was noted  as ‘services’ in this study (2008). Most  interviews were held either on the first floor of  The Business Place Headquarters in Johannesburg  CBD, while others were conducted at the  location of the business or an alternative  location chosen by the entrepreneur.  <p>The interview instrument used for this study  was a revised version of Abigail Barr’s  original  Entrepreneurial Network Diversity  Questionnaire  used for her study of the  Ghanaian manufacturing industry in Accra,  Ghana (1995). South African entrepreneurs  were asked of their relationship with eight  entities –  1) similar entrepreneurs; 2) different  entrepreneurs; 3) entrepreneurs in other South  African provinces; 4) entrepreneurs in other  countries; 5) immigrant entrepreneurs; 6)  larger businesses; 7) government; and 8)  financial institutions.  The following five  questions were asked about the relationship  with each of the aforementioned entities:   a How many people do you know in this <p>particular group?  <p>b Is this (are these) relationship valuable to <p>your business? If so, how?  <p>c How often do you communicate with <p>contacts in this group?  <p>d When did you meet the first contact in this <p>group?  <p>e How did you meet them?  <p>As a key initiating question, I asked the  entrepreneurs to ‘tell their story.’ This ‘story  telling’ provided a richness of data that largely  illustrated the process of their development,  the relationships along their journey, and an  elaboration of the subject’s context through  their own voice.  <p>In alignment with the literature, and for the  sake of simplification, the diversity of relation- ships is loosely categorised as bonds, bridges,  and linkages. Although entrepreneurs were  asked about their relationships with eight types  of entities, qualitative data unveiled that  entrepreneurs interacted with each type of  entity in multiple ways. Hence, 16 distinct  bond, bridge, and linkage relationships were  derived from the data, each bearing their own  functionality and contributing their unique  value to the entrepreneur’s experience. This  differentiation was useful in dispelling the  monolithic perception of broadly labeled groups,  such as ‘different types of entrepreneurs’ or  ‘government.’ Since listing the specifics of all  16 relationships is beyond the scope of this  paper, the structural depiction of their network  will simply convey this diversity in terms of  bonds, bridges, and linkages, providing details  of the most prominent relationships. Each  relational type is differentiated by the node’s  geometric shape.   <p>The concept of Network Diversity Structure  (NDS) refers to the structural arrangement of  the diverse relationships within the small  entrepreneurs’ networks. NDS in this study  was comprised of three defining properties, as  derived from the data:  <p>4.2.1 The diversity of relationships.   The primary conceptual identities of – and the  sub relationships within - the categories of  different bonds, bridges, and linkages derived  from the data via the coding analysis.  <p>4.2.2 The relative number of relationships <p>for every type.  <p>Dimensions of this property (i.e. many, some,  few, and none) were assigned a summative  scale (i.e. 3,2,1,0 respectively) as well as  geometric shapes of consecutive size order in  order to visually depict a scale of group size.  In other words, a large number of contacts  were depicted by geometrically-shaped nodes  of a corresponding size.  <p>4.2.3 The relative closeness of the ties to the <p>entrepreneur in the network.  <p>The conceptual property of ‘the closeness of  ties,’ is measured here by how often they  communicate and how valuable the relationship  is to their business. Closeness refers to the  distance of a relationship to the entrepreneur  based upon 1) how much he or she values the  relationship, and 2) how much time is spent  with the entity. To visually convey the close  relationships in a network, the indicator  combines (by averaging) both the relationship  properties of  value  and  frequency.  A summative <p>scale is assigned to the dimensions of each of  the properties so as to calculate the average.  The calculated average of the Value and  Frequency dimensions corresponds with different  spheres of the entrepreneur’s network (see  Figures 1 and 2), which are also assigned a  summative scale. The study proposes, as  suggested by the data, that the less the value  and/or the lower the frequency of communication,  the farther the relationship. Visually, a less  close relationship is conveyed by greater  distance – or a longer line – between the  central entrepreneur (the white circle in the  middle) and the contact. The data does not  sufficiently suggest that either the Value or  Frequency variable influences entrepreneurial  development more than the other, and hence,  are weighed the same. Nonetheless, this aspect  is worthy of further examination in future  studies.  <p>The NDS diagrams for both clothing <p>manufacturing (Entrepreneur Set I) and service  entrepreneurs (Entrepreneur Set II) is conveyed  in Figure 1 and 2, respectively.  <p>The NDS for each set of entrepreneurs reveals  a visible contrast in closeness of their most  prominent  relationships.  Similarly,  both <p>network structures also reveal comparable  farness of the same relationships. The  following section will compare the structure of  both networks in its most obvious differences.  Subsequent parts of the discussion will then  highlight the identity of the innermost cluster  of relationships depicted in both networks in  order to further unveil the nature of diversity  and the process to which they contribute value.  <p>The contrast between the structural depictions  of the networks portrays an obvious difference  in the general distance of relationships from  the central entrepreneur. As made clear by the  contrast in the images, the obvious difference  between both network diagrams is that of the  closeness  of the relationships to the central  actor, and inversely, the  farness  of the  relationships visually residing in the outer <p>rings of the depictions. It is to be noted, that  this study conceptualises closeness derived  from qualitative data and analysis. Conceptually,  based upon the data, a relationship that is  close  to the entrepreneur is that with which   the entrepreneur engages and communicates  frequently as well as values highly in regards  to their business. In turn, relationships that are  less close are those, which at the time, were  not perceived as valuable to the business and  with which communication was seldom.  <p>The network depictions are star-shaped, ego <p>centric formulations. The qualitative coding of  closeness is structurally conveyed in the  location of the node on the diagram. The  closeness coding of each entrepreneur-within  each set - was then aggregated to inform where  the node should be placed on the diagram. Ties  drawn  from  the  nodes  to  the  central <p>entrepreneur portrayed the visual distance of  each relationship. <p>This inner ring hosts the relationships <p>considered  very valuable  and communicated  with  very frequently.  The ‘inner-most’ circle  reveal the most obvious contrast between <p>depictions. The network of Entrepreneur Set I  shows the innermost circle to be occupied with  multiple types of relationships as well as a  large number of each. In fact, the bulk of  relationships within this network reside within  the first and second concentric circle. In  contrast no nodes relationally reside within the  ‘inner-most’ circle of the of Entrepreneur Set  II. The closest relationships border on the  second and third concentric circles from the  center.  <p>With the first set of entrepreneurs, a variety <p>of bond and bridge relationships constitute the  close hub of their network within which the  central entrepreneur is situated. The coding of  data regarding relationships with  similar entre- preneurs  revealed two distinct relationships  depicted by circular-shaped nodes. They were  labeled as  peer bonds  and  mentor bonds.  The  shortness of their distance from the central  entrepreneur suggests that clothing entrepreneurs  appeared to frequently communication with  entrepreneurs of the same industry. <p>Peer bonds refer to those relationships with <p>similarly small firms in the fashion industry.  The relatively large visual conveyance of  peer  bonds  suggests that clothing entrepreneurs  have many relationships with other clothing  entrepreneurs. Frequent and casual interaction  with peer bonds would offer the pleasant and  inspiring exchange of ideas for fashion  innovation. Data confirmed this as the micro- businesses interviewed attested to constant  engagement in both formal (i.e. fashion shows)  and informal settings (i.e. shared studio or  workspaces). Charged by personal exchanges  ranging from prevailing ideas of youth  identity, politics, and global trends to the  sharing of newly-founded sources for materials  or exhibit shows, peer bonds provided a space  where emerging entrepreneurs’ dreams and  creativity could be shared. In these relation- ships clothing entrepreneurs would experience  the artistic freedom to explore all boundaries  of design with their peers– regarding which  combination of colors and fabrics alongside  the controversial formulation of collective  symbolism and meaning creation that would  shape garments that speak to South Africa’s  dynamic marketplace. Peer bonds were most  valuable when they were constructive and  trustworthy,  as  some  entrepreneurs  also <p>acknowledged a competitive spirit and infor- mation hoarding behavior that would occasionally  manifest between entrepreneurs of the fashion  industry.  <p>Mentor bonds described ties with more <p>advanced fashion designers. Entrepreneurs would  often attest to holding apprenticeships in the  studios of established designers during the  early stages of their career. In this relationship,  they spoke to gaining invaluable knowledge in  the technical and artistic skill of the garment  creation process as they contributed directly to  the value chain of innovation and production in  their mentor’s shop. Furthermore, they would  gain insights in how to run the business side of  the clothing manufacturing sector. The initial  stages of the apprenticeship would entail small  contributions of design and assembly from the  young entrepreneurs. As they would mature in  their development, their responsibilities within  the shop would increase, from overseeing  components of the design process to producing  whole fashion lines or managing the general  business activity of the organisation.  <p>Square-shaped nodes in the network structure <p>depict bridging relationships, or those that  connect the central entrepreneur to groups that  have dissimilar attributes. Several relationship  types with a bridging quality were coded from  the data regarding  entrepreneurs of dissimilar  industries  and  immigrant entrepreneurs.  The  data revealed a relational type labeled  communal  bridges -  those relationships exhibiting such  visible closeness to the central entre-preneur,  often in the arrangement of a close-knit circle  of high trust and familiarity. The high  frequency of interaction that these relationships  offered were often enabled by the close  physical proximity between entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs would describe the buzzing and  gregarious environment of work and friendship  formed within buildings that have several  studios and workspaces belonging to small  enterprises from different fields or the opening  of an entrepreneur’s shop to others within  which a communal space of co-creating,  exchange, and relating in life and passion   was made. Hence, through these enjoyable  exchanges, relationships would grow and  people valued each beyond the potential  contribution they could offer to one’s business  growth alone. Such an atmosphere of trust and <p>respect served to forming business partnerships  in launching new, unprecedented initiatives. In  this regard the growing entrepreneur is  becoming more privy to the opportunities of  innovation and collaboration that exists with  working alongside the likes of entrepreneurs  from all angles of artistic expression as well as  those in sectors such as transportation,  catering, and event planning. The culture of  treating each other as ‘family’ built the  expectation of freely sharing information and  sharing creative ideas with one another without  fear of duplication. A supportive and more  secure environment augmented through the  familial atmosphere cultivated the assurance  that one’s innovations and originality would be  respected. The environment also encourages  increased sense of world awareness. <p>When asked to describe their relationship <p>with immigrant entrepreneurs (interpreted as  nationals from other African countries),  clothing entrepreneurs consistently referred to  a process of consulting immigrant entre- preneurs for production assistance or a  specialised skill. They referred to this process  as ‘outsourcing.’ Such insight led to the  conceptualisation of the  outsource bridge. <p>As apparent in the network diagram, the <p>outsource bridge also holds close ties to  entrepreneurs of the first set, and in sizeable  number. Often, clothing entrepreneurs from  other countries have specialised skills - such as  embroidery, buttoning, or cloth painting - which  are common in their respective countries’  clothing and fashion industry. Additionally,  they often possess specialised machinery –  such as an embroidery machine. Furthermore  clothing microbusinesses experience a surplus  of demand which their production capacity  cannot bear alone, risking poor workmanship,  late delivery, and the loss of clientele. In both  these circumstances, South African clothing  entrepreneurs would seek the services of  immigrant entrepreneurs. <p>Immigrant entrepreneurs gradually play an <p>essential role in the communal bridging  process as they contribute to a culture of a  receptive, open, and diverse exchange. Hence,  the value of their ties is drawn from the mutual  assistance and sense of security naturally  fostered by these intimate business relation- ships. Participating in the hub of information <p>by which entrepreneurs access less expensive  supplies and other artisans with specialised  skill, they represent another relationally driven  resource. Such relationships are particularly  operationally valuable as they would relieve  the small entrepreneur’s burden of performing  all the work ‘in house’ as well as enabling the  high level production without bearing the legal  implications and financial obligations of hiring  workers for which they may not have the  capacity. <p>Collaborative bridges , a relationship repre-<p>sented by another square-shaped node of high  closeness to the central entrepreneur, refers to  the ties between entrepreneurs who would take  on business opportunities in the form of  combined production assets and joint agreements.  In contrast to communal bridges, as the data  suggest,  collaborative bridges  are based more  upon the project and appear to be much less  intimate. They were not apt to be described in  terms of friendships and family as communal  bridges were. Rather, they appeared to strictly  serve an income-generating purpose – increasing  capacity for joint agreement so as to increase  productivity or to provide means of expansion  or diversification for the small clothing  enterprise. Hence the primary value of  colla- borative bridges  with entrepreneurs of a  different line of business is related to increased  productivity. By combining resources and  production capacities, small businesses are  able to provide for markets of greater demand  and compete at levels at which, by themselves,  they would be less able. Small businesses  continue to acquire knowledge of new trends  and techniques as they begin to engage with  these new market opportunities. Furthermore,  via this collaboration, small businesses acquire  means by which to engage with potential  partners and gain access to unfamiliar markets  and new business activities. <p>On the other hand, the general NDS of <p>service entrepreneurs depicts a relatively  smaller network, in terms of the numbers and  diversity of relationships, and a looser network,  where relationships qualitatively conveyed a  farther distance from the central entrepreneur.  In sharp contrast to the network of clothing  entrepreneurs, the bulk of relationships which  constitute the inner-circle of closely positioned  ties did not exist within the service entre-<p>preneurial NDS. Service entrepreneurs made  nearly no reference, for example, to the need  and/or recognition of high trust, close knit  entrepreneurial spaces within which small  firms of different industries engage in a  collaborative creation process, as depicted in  the  communal bridges  within clothing entre- preneurs’ networks .  Rather, the data conveyed  that service entrepreneurs appear to work  largely independently, and source support from  each other on a need-basis. The qualitative  relational dimension of entrepreneurial engage-  ment that appeared to be of such high value to  clothing entrepreneurs did not emerge in the  data of service entrepreneurs. O utsource  bridges  - also a highly prominent tie of the  clothing entrepreneurs’ NDS – appeared not to  be as evident among service entrepreneurs’  networks. Data presented little evidence that a  close relationship between service entrepreneurs  and immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of  shared production was a common occurrence.  The occasional mentioning of immigrant  entrepreneurs suggested relationships on a  friendly basis, but very little on production- or  capacity-building value. Outsourcing as a  general practice was not frequently mentioned  among service microbusinesses to substantiate  a conceptual relationship, although some  entrepreneurs did mention the occasional  hiring of freelance work to carry a project on  to completion.  <p>So then, what  did  the structure of network  diversity among service entrepreneurs convey?  From first glance, the obvious distinction is  that the network diagram depicts nodes to be  structurally farther from the central entre- preneur in set II than in set I. Nonetheless,  relationships which  were  positioned the closest  – and hence valued highly and communicated  with frequently - were those with larger  entities and institutions, namely government  and larger corporations. This observation is an  intriguing contrast to clothing entrepreneurs,  where the closest relationships were with  similarly sized firms of the same or different  industry.  <p>The data conveyed that these particular ties <p>for service entrepreneurs mostly take place in <p>the form of sub-contracting. The triangular- shaped nodes represent a tie with an  institution. A linkage with governmental  institutions that is of particular closeness to  service entrepreneurs was coded the  public  agency linkage.  This tie represents a connection  with a government agency, often times  facilitated through the awarding of tenders.  Service entrepreneurs also spoke of how they  sought to be placed on government databases  so as to be consulted in time of needed services  that they may provide. Similarly , corporate  client bridges  represented relationships with  larger businesses where the microbusiness was  hired to provide a precise service towards the  company’s overall value chain. Both ties were  deemed as highly valued ties because they  provide a small firm with the opportunities to  become part of larger production chain hosted  by a bigger organisation, and hence, an  entrance into the industry. Additionally,  public  incubator linkages –  government-related or  funded business development services, also  represent one of the closer positioned nodes as  service firms affirmed their high valued  provision of skills and training to increase the  effectiveness of their firms.  <p>Relationships such as the  corporate client <p>bridge or  public agency  linkage held a position  of moderate closeness within the network  structure of the clothing entrepreneurs. Only  those fashion entrepreneurs who had the  capacity  to  manage  voluminous  orders <p>considered doing business with larger firms as  a positive contribution to their businesses’  growth. Hence, the ability of small clothing  firms to engage in contractual agreements as  suppliers of mass-produced garment goods to  corporate clients appeared to be a function of  business capability and maturity. The same is  the case with ties with government agencies.  Unlike service entrepreneurs, only a few  clothing entrepreneurs perceived  public agency  linkages –  relationships in which clothing  entrepreneurs were suppliers to government  agencies  –  as valuable, suggesting clothing  entrepreneurs formed these relationships under  certain conditions or at a particular time in the  development of their capabilities. Instead, the  closer links that clothing entrepreneurs had  with government were more in the form of  personal ties, codes as  public official linkages. <p>Public official linkages refer to a relationship  whereas individual government officials and  their affiliates (i.e. spouse, friends) are direct  purchasers – and hence, provide useful input  towards the development of - the designer’s  creation.  <p>Comparatively,  financial  linkages  and <p>global bridges  appear to be relationships of  least closeness for both entrepreneurial groups.  Although  both  groups  of  entrepreneurs <p>expressed their desire to connect to parties  overseas – to whom they could distribute their  goods or extend their services – and to secure  financing from banks, the reality held that to  maintain either relationship was difficult.  Having few acquaintances in other countries –  and not having consistent access to internet –  served as two critical reasons for the low value  and communication infrequency of global  bridges. The unproven viability of most  entrepreneurs interviewed appeared to be a  deterrence to securing formal financial credit. <p>The analysis has revealed a nuanced con- ceptualisation of relationships beyond the  simplification of bonds, bridges, and linkages  in order to capture the contextual features  within which the innovation process is  embedded. Clothing microbusinesses frequently  communicate with a combination of ties across  similar and dissimilar entrepreneurs. Within  this exchange is a reiterative process of sharing  ideas and inspiration towards the creation of  the product. Further, data described an  innovation process that goes beyond the  conceptualisation of design. The synergistic  combining of resources and capacities also  lend to the innovation of mutually beneficial  processes by which small firms can achieve the  multiple goals of producing high quality, niche  products that meet a burgeoning demand  beyond their individual capacities. As a result,  participating entrepreneurs in the innovation  process would collaboratively secure a revenue  stream from which both draw income. These  ties of the ‘inner circle’ would vary in their  relational closeness, and range in perception as  ‘friends and family’ to the collegial but more  product-driven partnerships. Either way, these <p>distinct attributes of the clothing entrepreneur  constituted a dynamic innovation process  supported by the closeness of these diverse  relationships. On the other hand, data from  entrepreneurs in the service sector does not  speak of this on-going engagement of  collaborative creation. Their network structure  qualitatively – and hence visually - appears to  be more dispersed. Their ‘closest’ ties were  those with institutions and larger organisations.  Even in these relationships, the coded data  revealed only a moderate frequency of  interaction and very little on co-creation or  collaboration. Arguably, the innovation process  may be hampered by the established bureau- cracy of such organisations that allow limited  space for bargaining, negotiating, or creating  meaning of multiple sources of knowledge and  experience. Consequentially, such ties provide  the great value in presenting opportunities of  entering the industry by which a small  enterprise of emerging capacity, can become  an integrated component of an established  organisation’s value chain with a proven  competitive advantage. <p>Hence, the primary gain is that innovation is <p>a highly socially embedded process within a  network structure of close, diverse ties.  Moreover, the central argument posed that  qualitative,  intangible,  and  experiential <p>aspects of closeness – fostered by the structural  composition of closeness – is critical in  fostering the innovation process as well.  <p>The findings were generally supported by <p>the literature on networks and firm innovation.  Overall, the literature supports a generally  positive relationship between networks and  innovation, which Pittaway et al. (2004)  confirm through their comprehensive systematic  review of both conceptual and empirical  works. Tsai (2001) highlights that network  position does have a positive impact on  innovation, mediated by the actor’s capacity to  absorb the knowledge gained externally.  Lipparini & Sobrero (1994) bring particular  attention to small and medium enterprises, as  they argue that small enterprises can use their  relational capabilities to find new combinations  of  knowledge  and  further  competitive <p>advantage beyond the limitations of their size.  Similarly, this study confirms such insight by  exploring the interaction between network <p>structure and sector, while keeping the firm  size constant. Future studies that examine how  the link between the variation in firm size and  sector informs networks of innovation value  has useful implications for business develop- ment (Rogers, 2004). <p>The specific attention given to the structural <p>closeness of an entrepreneur’s network as an  innovation-enabling attribute resonates with  findings of those such as Schilling & Phelps  (2007), who emphasise the  reach  and  cluster of a firm’s relationships as significant  contributors to the innovation process. The  reach  - referring to the capacity to access  diverse actors and a wider array of knowledge,  and  cluster -  referring to the positioning of  nodes that permit the high degree of exchange  and information – bear semantic variation but  conceptual resemblance to the noted ideas of  diversity and closeness in this study. Swan,  Newell, Scarbrough, and Hislop, (1999) echo  the imminent value of having actors in spaces  of close proximity so as to facilitate consistent  engagement and exchange.  <p>Nonetheless, the ‘relational’ or ‘experiential’ <p>closeness that diverse actors of a network share  is a very distinct dimension from that of the  ‘structural’ closeness. This study would argue  that it is the structural closeness that creates  the environment conducive to the cultivation  of the relational closeness. And as mentioned,  this study argues that it is within this  qualitative, intangible experience of closeness  that the innovation between actors is spurred  and facilitated. Swan et al.’s (1999) study of  community-based networking affirms this  logic by highlighting the collaborative co- creation and negotiation of knowledge that  enables institutionally-defying innovation of  people working together. According to Blomqvist  & Levy (2006), this engagement demands the  prerequisite of a ‘collaborative capacity’ that  describes the genuine activation of trust,  commitment, and communication in participating  actors– in order to optimise the interactions  taking place in the network.  <p>Ahuja’s (2000) empirical work, however, <p>reminds us that different aspects of an  entrepreneur’s network can provide contradictory  aspects  to  an  entrepreneur’s  innovation <p>process. Although this was not a prevalent  theme that emerged from the data, a few <p>respondents occasionally mentioned a competitive,  rather  than  collegial,  attitude  between <p>entrepreneurs. This aspect was acknowledged  as a social and attitudinal dimension of the  entrepreneurial community that could influence  innovation in adverse ways and is worthy of  further exploration.  <p>The proposed argument presents alternative <p>insights to two respected assertions presented  in the economic sociology literature. First,  Granovetter’s  strength of weak ties  argument  has long been revered and is foundational in  the social embeddedness literature (1973).  Granovetter postulates that ties beyond one’s  immediate identity group, allow an actor to  access a variety of information that aids in  their economic advancement. The findings  from this study suggest that among micro- businesses in this emerging market setting,  different types of ties provide different types of  economic value, rather than asserting that one  type of tie has more economic value than  another (Ahuja, 2000). Hence, the qualitative  findings from this study suggest that close ties  – which would be considered ‘strong ties’ in  Granovetter’s study, and in turn, not as  economically potent –  actually  have innovation-  oriented value towards the economic success  of microenterprises. “Strong ties” of highly  perceived value and high frequency of  communication provide a space of continual  exchange, inspiration, and combined capacities  as all parts of the co-creation process.  <p>A second assertion of Abigail Barr (2002) <p>suggested that, in lieu of studying the network  use of Ghanaian manufacturing firms, there is  a difference depending upon the firm size. She  argues that large firms draw innovative value  from their networks, whereas small firms  ideally source security from their web of  relationships. The South African case presented  here argues that the dichotomy between  ‘secure’ and ‘innovative’ networks is to be  further interrogated. Rather, this study suggests  that the innovation process is  embedded  and  driven  by a sense of secure relationships –  those fueled by a high sense of trust,  relateability, and mutual respect.  <p>Such structural and relational emphasis of <p>closeness, and closeness with diverse nodes, as  a network attribute which promotes innovation  confirms  that  innovation  is  indeed  an <p>embedded process (Oerlemans, Meeus, &  Boekena, 1998). This study emphasises that  ‘closeness’ has a very distinct qualitative  interpretation in the relational understanding of  small enterprises’ networks beyond just  calculated distance or structural position.  “Closeness” captures an intangible and yet  extremely meaningful set of relational variables  that spark not only a sense of mutual  appreciation between people or organisations,  but moreover, the desire to work together, to  expose inner thoughts and ideas, to entrust to  each other future ambitions or current <p>struggles. It is a particular dimension of  relational capital that embodies the elements of  deep meaning and helps to create the  experiences and memories created by entities  every time they engage. And such ‘closeness’  depicts not only a static relational attribute, but  that which has the potential of converting into  economic value, as the ability to mutually  envision, design, and build translates into  collaborations around niche products, reputeable  brands, quality production, and operational  efficiency that gives a firm of any size an  endearing and competitive advantage.

              "'<p>Eliada Griffin-EL <p>Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town <p>Accepted: January 2014 <p>JEL: D85, J15, L26, M13 <p>Micro-sized but formally registered businesses  of the South African entrepreneurial landscape  occupy a particular place on the country’s  development agenda. As micro-enterprises,  they face the well-known challenges of  achieving scale and productivity levels; yet, as  formally registered businesses, they serve as a  bridge between the central and peripheral  markets that both constitute the South African  economy. With their failure rates presumed to  be high, yet their success presumed to be  important, understanding how they facilitate  their entrepreneurial process while having  limited capacity becomes a question of both  intrigue and development implications for  economic inclusivity.  <p>The purpose of this study is to explore the <p>structural embeddedness of South African  microbusinesses – and to better understand how  they have engaged with the social relationships  in which they are embedded in order to  advance and support their entrepreneurial  activity. This study is driven by the initial  open-ended research question, “Is there value <p>in microbusinesses’ relationships that enable  them to entrepreneurially function – and even  excel - beyond their resource and capacity  constraints?’ Inspired by assumptions of the  economic sociological literature, the analysis  attempts to visually depict the shape of their  ego-centric networks, in order to convey the  perceptual distance or closeness that they bear  with various entities. Additionally, the study  provides a conceptualisation of the diversity  relational types and entrepreneurial value they  contribute.  <p>Conducted as a comparative grounded <p>theory analysis, data was collected via the in- depth interviews of 30 formally registered  microbusinesses of black South African entre- preneurs from the (clothing) manufacturing (set  I) and service sectors (set II). The study took  place in Greater Johannesburg in partnership  with The Business Place. All firms included/  involved? employed 10 or less employees.  <p>As suggested by findings of the qualitative <p>analysis, the study presents the central  proposition that the innovation process involved  in a microbusiness’s value chain is facilitated  by a high degree of  closeness  with a diverse set  of relationships. Microenterprises in the <p>Abstract <p>clothing manufacturing sector appear to have a  higher degree of closeness with a diverse array  of actors, which enables them to undergo an  interaction-oriented innovation process as a  key part of their entrepreneurial process. The  data did not present similar evidence to suggest  the service microenterprises’ networks support  the same phenomenon. Moreover, the data  emphasises the relational nature of the  innovation processes in design and production  by engaging in a collaborative creation process  with similar and different microbusinesses.  Hence relationships with these individuals tend  to be highly valued and enacted frequently,  facilitating a closeness. Network diversity  structure (NDS), an original core concept of  the emergent theoretical framework, refers to  the degree of closeness, diversity, and number  of relationship types that constitutes the  structural shape of ties. As in the grounded  theory tradition, the discussion explores how  the findings are supported by - and contribute  to - the literature on networks and innovation.  <p>Social  embeddedness  and  social  capital <p>literature suggest that <p>interactions,  and norms inform economic behavior that  shapes the market. In turn<p>entrepreneurs  influence - and are influenced by - their  engagement with the broader society within  which they are embedded (Granovetter, 1985;  Giddens, 1986; Woolcock, 1998; Grootaert,  Narayan, Jones, & Woolcock, 2003; Dobbin,  2004; Urban, 2011). At the core is the  assumption that an economic actor makes his  or her decisions resulting from a negotiation of  their personal utility and the information and  norms they draw from their engagement with  others  (Granovetter,  1985).  The  social <p>embeddedness perspective moves away from  the  individual-  or  organisational-centered <p>outlook of entrepreneurship and provides a  view by which to examine entrepreneurs in  respect to their relational context (Portes &  Sensenbrenner, 1993; Portes, 1998). Network  studies particularly examine “the structure of  the relations between social actors and how  patterns in those relations influence a variety  of outcomes,” (Stuart & Sorenson, 2005:233). <p>Also referred to as a structural analysis,  network studies assist in unveiling the  restrictions and opportunities that an actor  inherits as a result of the relationships they are  embedded within (Garcia, 2006). Hoang and  Antoncic (2003) acknowledge the need for  theory building that captures the nexus  between outcome- and process-oriented studies.  This speaks to the dynamism of networks and  their ability to support a small firm’s evolving  needs (Hite & Hesterly, 2001). It is in this gap  of networks’ role in the entrepreneurial process  that this study hopes to contribute.  <p>This study draws from social capital <p>literature’s broad distinctions across relationship  types. Horizontal relationships – or bonds and  bridges - loosely describe relationships between  entities from close, familial settings and similar  characteristics and relationships between parties  of different circles or communities, respectively  (Gittell & Vidal, 1998; Woolcock & Narayan,  2000). Vertical relationships, termed as linkages,  refer to relationships between entities and  institutions (Woolcock, 1998, 2002). Bonds,  bridges,  and  linkages  will  provide  the <p>conceptual language and theoretical reference  point of the idea of diversity in networks.  <p>Apart from the entrepreneurial process, the <p>empirical arm of the literature tends to focus  on the characteristics influencing, resources  gained from, or the composition of the network  structure. Attributes such as culture (Greve &  Salaff, 2003; Klyver, Hindle, & Meyer, 2008),  economic sector (Spence, Schmidpeter, &  Habisch, 2003), and business phase (Klyver et  al., 2008) of entrepreneurs have been featured.  Size (Barr, 1995; 2002); global exposure  (Mcdade & Spring, 2005); gender (Kuada,  2009; Rutashobya, Allan, & Nilsson, 2009);  one’s ‘identity landscape’ (Pingle, 2001); and  ethnicity (Bruce, 2003) are also highlighted  entrepreneurial attributes that lend to network  structural variation. Broader environmental  factors – such as the degree of regional  development (Garcia, 2006) or economic  liberalisation (Meagher, 2006) – have also  been recognised as a contributing variable.  Resource- based network studies highlight  network gains – such as knowledge acquisition  and production capacities (Yli-Renko, Autio, &  Sapienza, 2001); security (Barr, 1995, 2002);  and innovation aspects (Barr, 1995, 1002; <p>Bakker, Oerlemans, & Pretorius, 2008). Social  arrangements such as familial ties (Luo, 1997;  Fafchamps & Minten, 2002); sub-contracting  ties (Luo, 1997); home-based networks (Zhou,  Wu, & Luo, 2007); and extra-, inter-, and  intra-firm linkages (Yeung, 1997) describe the  network composition that even enable a small  firm’s adjustment to global changes (Chen,  2009; Lu & Beamish, 2001; Yeung, 1997;  Zhou et al., 2007).  <p>Although the literature appears to be <p>growing, there is still much more to learn  about how network structure facilitates the  entrepreneurial process- particularly with small,  emerging firms within African economies  which are increasingly opening and connecting  to a global economy (Naude & Havenga,  2005). Studying the formally registered micro- business community within the backdrop of a  dynamic emerging economy such as South  Africa bears its own distinct significance  (Human, 2009). The relational structures of  such firms embody both formal and informal  ties that span the formal and peripheral  economies. Hence, an inductive, exploratory  approach is applied in order to grasp the  network characteristics that are embedded  within diverse economic domains. <p>Data was analysed using the grounded theory  methodology.  Entrepreneurial  research  in <p>general, as Makela and Turcan (2007) suggest,  has room to be enriched by the capturing of  nuanced factors. Grounded theory analysis,  like most qualitative analyses, guides the  investigator  towards  identifying  abstract <p>themes from the raw data. Grounded theory’s  distinguishing objective is to derive an original  ‘theory’ from the data which conceptually  captures  the  intrinsic  process  of  the <p>phenomenon being studied (Glaser & Strauss,  1967). Beyond the initial phase of thematic  coding, analysis also entails a constant  comparison and categorisation of codes to  gradually reveal the main concepts of the  emerging theory. Upon reaching theoretical  saturation, the central conceptual category is <p>identified to which all other conceptual  categories relate to build an explicatory  narrative of the phenomenon. Propositions can  be formed to be tested in future studies.  (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin,  1990). <p>Data was collected in June to August of 2008  via in-depth, open-ended interviews with thirty  micro-sized South African firms. The sample  was constructed via random selection of  willing, available firms from The Business  Place Opportunity Exchange Database, The  Johannesburg Fashion Week listings, and to a  lesser extent, the snow-balling method via  referrals. ‘Micro’ in this study is defined as  firms hiring ten or less full-time employees.  All the businesses were formally registered in  South Africa and all the entrepreneurs were  black South Africans. Approximately 47 per  cent of the subjects interviewed hired at least  one employee and 30 per cent spoke to having  at least one business partner. The median age  of the business organisations was three years,  ranging from a minimum of 4 months to a  maximum of 12 years. More than 50 per cent  of the entrepreneurs themselves fell within the  ages of 25 and 30, the youngest being 21 and  the oldest more than 50. 47 per cent of  entrepreneurs operated their businesses from  the Central Business District of Johannesburg.  The remaining were based in the broader  Johannesburg metropolitan area consisting of  the surrounding townships, suburbs, and towns  – such as Soweto, Vosloorus, Benoni, Alberton,  and Vereeninging in the Vaal.  <p>The broad spectrum of enterprises of <p>various ages that are featured in the study hold  the commonality of being microenterprises. In  this study, their small scale is primarily  measured in terms of employment, where all  firms have ten or less employees. The broad  spectrum allows for the analysis to identify  patterns common across the relational structure  of micro-enterprises, despite the duration of  time that have been in operation. In this  manner, the variable of size is kept constant.  Extended analysis, as well as literature, does  suggest that the structure of networks for even  small-scale enterprises varies by the age of the  firm. Nonetheless, considered beyond the <p>scope of this study, the analysis focuses upon  cross-cutting network trends across micro- firms of all ages for this phase of the analysis.  <p>Of all the subjects interviewed, data from <p>twenty-four firms was analysed. Exactly half  of the set are from the clothing/fashion  manufacturing industry. The other 50 per cent  was comprised of firms from the service  industries - five construction firms, four media  and publicity firms, and three health and  beauty enterprises. Firms which were self- labeled ‘construction firms’ mostly provided  services of customised renovation and design  services to both private and public property.  Such work is categorised under ‘specialised  consumer discretionary services,’ according to  the Standard and Poor’s Global Industry  Classification Standard, and hence, was noted  as ‘services’ in this study (2008). Most  interviews were held either on the first floor of  The Business Place Headquarters in Johannesburg  CBD, while others were conducted at the  location of the business or an alternative  location chosen by the entrepreneur.  <p>The interview instrument used for this study  was a revised version of Abigail Barr’s  original  Entrepreneurial Network Diversity  Questionnaire  used for her study of the  Ghanaian manufacturing industry in Accra,  Ghana (1995). South African entrepreneurs  were asked of their relationship with eight  entities –  1) similar entrepreneurs; 2) different  entrepreneurs; 3) entrepreneurs in other South  African provinces; 4) entrepreneurs in other  countries; 5) immigrant entrepreneurs; 6)  larger businesses; 7) government; and 8)  financial institutions.  The following five  questions were asked about the relationship  with each of the aforementioned entities:   a How many people do you know in this <p>particular group?  <p>b Is this (are these) relationship valuable to <p>your business? If so, how?  <p>c How often do you communicate with <p>contacts in this group?  <p>d When did you meet the first contact in this <p>group?  <p>e How did you meet them?  <p>As a key initiating question, I asked the  entrepreneurs to ‘tell their story.’ This ‘story  telling’ provided a richness of data that largely  illustrated the process of their development,  the relationships along their journey, and an  elaboration of the subject’s context through  their own voice.  <p>In alignment with the literature, and for the  sake of simplification, the diversity of relation- ships is loosely categorised as bonds, bridges,  and linkages. Although entrepreneurs were  asked about their relationships with eight types  of entities, qualitative data unveiled that  entrepreneurs interacted with each type of  entity in multiple ways. Hence, 16 distinct  bond, bridge, and linkage relationships were  derived from the data, each bearing their own  functionality and contributing their unique  value to the entrepreneur’s experience. This  differentiation was useful in dispelling the  monolithic perception of broadly labeled groups,  such as ‘different types of entrepreneurs’ or  ‘government.’ Since listing the specifics of all  16 relationships is beyond the scope of this  paper, the structural depiction of their network  will simply convey this diversity in terms of  bonds, bridges, and linkages, providing details  of the most prominent relationships. Each  relational type is differentiated by the node’s  geometric shape.   <p>The concept of Network Diversity Structure  (NDS) refers to the structural arrangement of  the diverse relationships within the small  entrepreneurs’ networks. NDS in this study  was comprised of three defining properties, as  derived from the data:  <p>4.2.1 The diversity of relationships.   The primary conceptual identities of – and the  sub relationships within - the categories of  different bonds, bridges, and linkages derived  from the data via the coding analysis.  <p>4.2.2 The relative number of relationships <p>for every type.  <p>Dimensions of this property (i.e. many, some,  few, and none) were assigned a summative  scale (i.e. 3,2,1,0 respectively) as well as  geometric shapes of consecutive size order in  order to visually depict a scale of group size.  In other words, a large number of contacts  were depicted by geometrically-shaped nodes  of a corresponding size.  <p>4.2.3 The relative closeness of the ties to the <p>entrepreneur in the network.  <p>The conceptual property of ‘the closeness of  ties,’ is measured here by how often they  communicate and how valuable the relationship  is to their business. Closeness refers to the  distance of a relationship to the entrepreneur  based upon 1) how much he or she values the  relationship, and 2) how much time is spent  with the entity. To visually convey the close  relationships in a network, the indicator  combines (by averaging) both the relationship  properties of  value  and  frequency.  A summative <p>scale is assigned to the dimensions of each of  the properties so as to calculate the average.  The calculated average of the Value and  Frequency dimensions corresponds with different  spheres of the entrepreneur’s network (see  Figures 1 and 2), which are also assigned a  summative scale. The study proposes, as  suggested by the data, that the less the value  and/or the lower the frequency of communication,  the farther the relationship. Visually, a less  close relationship is conveyed by greater  distance – or a longer line – between the  central entrepreneur (the white circle in the  middle) and the contact. The data does not  sufficiently suggest that either the Value or  Frequency variable influences entrepreneurial  development more than the other, and hence,  are weighed the same. Nonetheless, this aspect  is worthy of further examination in future  studies.  <p>The NDS diagrams for both clothing <p>manufacturing (Entrepreneur Set I) and service  entrepreneurs (Entrepreneur Set II) is conveyed  in Figure 1 and 2, respectively.  <p>The NDS for each set of entrepreneurs reveals  a visible contrast in closeness of their most  prominent  relationships.  Similarly,  both <p>network structures also reveal comparable  farness of the same relationships. The  following section will compare the structure of  both networks in its most obvious differences.  Subsequent parts of the discussion will then  highlight the identity of the innermost cluster  of relationships depicted in both networks in  order to further unveil the nature of diversity  and the process to which they contribute value.  <p>The contrast between the structural depictions  of the networks portrays an obvious difference  in the general distance of relationships from  the central entrepreneur. As made clear by the  contrast in the images, the obvious difference  between both network diagrams is that of the  closeness  of the relationships to the central  actor, and inversely, the  farness  of the  relationships visually residing in the outer <p>rings of the depictions. It is to be noted, that  this study conceptualises closeness derived  from qualitative data and analysis. Conceptually,  based upon the data, a relationship that is  close  to the entrepreneur is that with which   the entrepreneur engages and communicates  frequently as well as values highly in regards  to their business. In turn, relationships that are  less close are those, which at the time, were  not perceived as valuable to the business and  with which communication was seldom.  <p>The network depictions are star-shaped, ego <p>centric formulations. The qualitative coding of  closeness is structurally conveyed in the  location of the node on the diagram. The  closeness coding of each entrepreneur-within  each set - was then aggregated to inform where  the node should be placed on the diagram. Ties  drawn  from  the  nodes  to  the  central <p>entrepreneur portrayed the visual distance of  each relationship. <p>This inner ring hosts the relationships <p>considered  very valuable  and communicated  with  very frequently.  The ‘inner-most’ circle  reveal the most obvious contrast between <p>depictions. The network of Entrepreneur Set I  shows the innermost circle to be occupied with  multiple types of relationships as well as a  large number of each. In fact, the bulk of  relationships within this network reside within  the first and second concentric circle. In  contrast no nodes relationally reside within the  ‘inner-most’ circle of the of Entrepreneur Set  II. The closest relationships border on the  second and third concentric circles from the  center.  <p>With the first set of entrepreneurs, a variety <p>of bond and bridge relationships constitute the  close hub of their network within which the  central entrepreneur is situated. The coding of  data regarding relationships with  similar entre- preneurs  revealed two distinct relationships  depicted by circular-shaped nodes. They were  labeled as  peer bonds  and  mentor bonds.  The  shortness of their distance from the central  entrepreneur suggests that clothing entrepreneurs  appeared to frequently communication with  entrepreneurs of the same industry. <p>Peer bonds refer to those relationships with <p>similarly small firms in the fashion industry.  The relatively large visual conveyance of  peer  bonds  suggests that clothing entrepreneurs  have many relationships with other clothing  entrepreneurs. Frequent and casual interaction  with peer bonds would offer the pleasant and  inspiring exchange of ideas for fashion  innovation. Data confirmed this as the micro- businesses interviewed attested to constant  engagement in both formal (i.e. fashion shows)  and informal settings (i.e. shared studio or  workspaces). Charged by personal exchanges  ranging from prevailing ideas of youth  identity, politics, and global trends to the  sharing of newly-founded sources for materials  or exhibit shows, peer bonds provided a space  where emerging entrepreneurs’ dreams and  creativity could be shared. In these relation- ships clothing entrepreneurs would experience  the artistic freedom to explore all boundaries  of design with their peers– regarding which  combination of colors and fabrics alongside  the controversial formulation of collective  symbolism and meaning creation that would  shape garments that speak to South Africa’s  dynamic marketplace. Peer bonds were most  valuable when they were constructive and  trustworthy,  as  some  entrepreneurs  also <p>acknowledged a competitive spirit and infor- mation hoarding behavior that would occasionally  manifest between entrepreneurs of the fashion  industry.  <p>Mentor bonds described ties with more <p>advanced fashion designers. Entrepreneurs would  often attest to holding apprenticeships in the  studios of established designers during the  early stages of their career. In this relationship,  they spoke to gaining invaluable knowledge in  the technical and artistic skill of the garment  creation process as they contributed directly to  the value chain of innovation and production in  their mentor’s shop. Furthermore, they would  gain insights in how to run the business side of  the clothing manufacturing sector. The initial  stages of the apprenticeship would entail small  contributions of design and assembly from the  young entrepreneurs. As they would mature in  their development, their responsibilities within  the shop would increase, from overseeing  components of the design process to producing  whole fashion lines or managing the general  business activity of the organisation.  <p>Square-shaped nodes in the network structure <p>depict bridging relationships, or those that  connect the central entrepreneur to groups that  have dissimilar attributes. Several relationship  types with a bridging quality were coded from  the data regarding  entrepreneurs of dissimilar  industries  and  immigrant entrepreneurs.  The  data revealed a relational type labeled  communal  bridges -  those relationships exhibiting such  visible closeness to the central entre-preneur,  often in the arrangement of a close-knit circle  of high trust and familiarity. The high  frequency of interaction that these relationships  offered were often enabled by the close  physical proximity between entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs would describe the buzzing and  gregarious environment of work and friendship  formed within buildings that have several  studios and workspaces belonging to small  enterprises from different fields or the opening  of an entrepreneur’s shop to others within  which a communal space of co-creating,  exchange, and relating in life and passion   was made. Hence, through these enjoyable  exchanges, relationships would grow and  people valued each beyond the potential  contribution they could offer to one’s business  growth alone. Such an atmosphere of trust and <p>respect served to forming business partnerships  in launching new, unprecedented initiatives. In  this regard the growing entrepreneur is  becoming more privy to the opportunities of  innovation and collaboration that exists with  working alongside the likes of entrepreneurs  from all angles of artistic expression as well as  those in sectors such as transportation,  catering, and event planning. The culture of  treating each other as ‘family’ built the  expectation of freely sharing information and  sharing creative ideas with one another without  fear of duplication. A supportive and more  secure environment augmented through the  familial atmosphere cultivated the assurance  that one’s innovations and originality would be  respected. The environment also encourages  increased sense of world awareness. <p>When asked to describe their relationship <p>with immigrant entrepreneurs (interpreted as  nationals from other African countries),  clothing entrepreneurs consistently referred to  a process of consulting immigrant entre- preneurs for production assistance or a  specialised skill. They referred to this process  as ‘outsourcing.’ Such insight led to the  conceptualisation of the  outsource bridge. <p>As apparent in the network diagram, the <p>outsource bridge also holds close ties to  entrepreneurs of the first set, and in sizeable  number. Often, clothing entrepreneurs from  other countries have specialised skills - such as  embroidery, buttoning, or cloth painting - which  are common in their respective countries’  clothing and fashion industry. Additionally,  they often possess specialised machinery –  such as an embroidery machine. Furthermore  clothing microbusinesses experience a surplus  of demand which their production capacity  cannot bear alone, risking poor workmanship,  late delivery, and the loss of clientele. In both  these circumstances, South African clothing  entrepreneurs would seek the services of  immigrant entrepreneurs. <p>Immigrant entrepreneurs gradually play an <p>essential role in the communal bridging  process as they contribute to a culture of a  receptive, open, and diverse exchange. Hence,  the value of their ties is drawn from the mutual  assistance and sense of security naturally  fostered by these intimate business relation- ships. Participating in the hub of information <p>by which entrepreneurs access less expensive  supplies and other artisans with specialised  skill, they represent another relationally driven  resource. Such relationships are particularly  operationally valuable as they would relieve  the small entrepreneur’s burden of performing  all the work ‘in house’ as well as enabling the  high level production without bearing the legal  implications and financial obligations of hiring  workers for which they may not have the  capacity. <p>Collaborative bridges , a relationship repre-<p>sented by another square-shaped node of high  closeness to the central entrepreneur, refers to  the ties between entrepreneurs who would take  on business opportunities in the form of  combined production assets and joint agreements.  In contrast to communal bridges, as the data  suggest,  collaborative bridges  are based more  upon the project and appear to be much less  intimate. They were not apt to be described in  terms of friendships and family as communal  bridges were. Rather, they appeared to strictly  serve an income-generating purpose – increasing  capacity for joint agreement so as to increase  productivity or to provide means of expansion  or diversification for the small clothing  enterprise. Hence the primary value of  colla- borative bridges  with entrepreneurs of a  different line of business is related to increased  productivity. By combining resources and  production capacities, small businesses are  able to provide for markets of greater demand  and compete at levels at which, by themselves,  they would be less able. Small businesses  continue to acquire knowledge of new trends  and techniques as they begin to engage with  these new market opportunities. Furthermore,  via this collaboration, small businesses acquire  means by which to engage with potential  partners and gain access to unfamiliar markets  and new business activities. <p>On the other hand, the general NDS of <p>service entrepreneurs depicts a relatively  smaller network, in terms of the numbers and  diversity of relationships, and a looser network,  where relationships qualitatively conveyed a  farther distance from the central entrepreneur.  In sharp contrast to the network of clothing  entrepreneurs, the bulk of relationships which  constitute the inner-circle of closely positioned  ties did not exist within the service entre-<p>preneurial NDS. Service entrepreneurs made  nearly no reference, for example, to the need  and/or recognition of high trust, close knit  entrepreneurial spaces within which small  firms of different industries engage in a  collaborative creation process, as depicted in  the  communal bridges  within clothing entre- preneurs’ networks .  Rather, the data conveyed  that service entrepreneurs appear to work  largely independently, and source support from  each other on a need-basis. The qualitative  relational dimension of entrepreneurial engage-  ment that appeared to be of such high value to  clothing entrepreneurs did not emerge in the  data of service entrepreneurs. O utsource  bridges  - also a highly prominent tie of the  clothing entrepreneurs’ NDS – appeared not to  be as evident among service entrepreneurs’  networks. Data presented little evidence that a  close relationship between service entrepreneurs  and immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of  shared production was a common occurrence.  The occasional mentioning of immigrant  entrepreneurs suggested relationships on a  friendly basis, but very little on production- or  capacity-building value. Outsourcing as a  general practice was not frequently mentioned  among service microbusinesses to substantiate  a conceptual relationship, although some  entrepreneurs did mention the occasional  hiring of freelance work to carry a project on  to completion.  <p>So then, what  did  the structure of network  diversity among service entrepreneurs convey?  From first glance, the obvious distinction is  that the network diagram depicts nodes to be  structurally farther from the central entre- preneur in set II than in set I. Nonetheless,  relationships which  were  positioned the closest  – and hence valued highly and communicated  with frequently - were those with larger  entities and institutions, namely government  and larger corporations. This observation is an  intriguing contrast to clothing entrepreneurs,  where the closest relationships were with  similarly sized firms of the same or different  industry.  <p>The data conveyed that these particular ties <p>for service entrepreneurs mostly take place in <p>the form of sub-contracting. The triangular- shaped nodes represent a tie with an  institution. A linkage with governmental  institutions that is of particular closeness to  service entrepreneurs was coded the  public  agency linkage.  This tie represents a connection  with a government agency, often times  facilitated through the awarding of tenders.  Service entrepreneurs also spoke of how they  sought to be placed on government databases  so as to be consulted in time of needed services  that they may provide. Similarly , corporate  client bridges  represented relationships with  larger businesses where the microbusiness was  hired to provide a precise service towards the  company’s overall value chain. Both ties were  deemed as highly valued ties because they  provide a small firm with the opportunities to  become part of larger production chain hosted  by a bigger organisation, and hence, an  entrance into the industry. Additionally,  public  incubator linkages –  government-related or  funded business development services, also  represent one of the closer positioned nodes as  service firms affirmed their high valued  provision of skills and training to increase the  effectiveness of their firms.  <p>Relationships such as the  corporate client <p>bridge or  public agency  linkage held a position  of moderate closeness within the network  structure of the clothing entrepreneurs. Only  those fashion entrepreneurs who had the  capacity  to  manage  voluminous  orders <p>considered doing business with larger firms as  a positive contribution to their businesses’  growth. Hence, the ability of small clothing  firms to engage in contractual agreements as  suppliers of mass-produced garment goods to  corporate clients appeared to be a function of  business capability and maturity. The same is  the case with ties with government agencies.  Unlike service entrepreneurs, only a few  clothing entrepreneurs perceived  public agency  linkages –  relationships in which clothing  entrepreneurs were suppliers to government  agencies  –  as valuable, suggesting clothing  entrepreneurs formed these relationships under  certain conditions or at a particular time in the  development of their capabilities. Instead, the  closer links that clothing entrepreneurs had  with government were more in the form of  personal ties, codes as  public official linkages. <p>Public official linkages refer to a relationship  whereas individual government officials and  their affiliates (i.e. spouse, friends) are direct  purchasers – and hence, provide useful input  towards the development of - the designer’s  creation.  <p>Comparatively,  financial  linkages  and <p>global bridges  appear to be relationships of  least closeness for both entrepreneurial groups.  Although  both  groups  of  entrepreneurs <p>expressed their desire to connect to parties  overseas – to whom they could distribute their  goods or extend their services – and to secure  financing from banks, the reality held that to  maintain either relationship was difficult.  Having few acquaintances in other countries –  and not having consistent access to internet –  served as two critical reasons for the low value  and communication infrequency of global  bridges. The unproven viability of most  entrepreneurs interviewed appeared to be a  deterrence to securing formal financial credit. <p>The analysis has revealed a nuanced con- ceptualisation of relationships beyond the  simplification of bonds, bridges, and linkages  in order to capture the contextual features  within which the innovation process is  embedded. Clothing microbusinesses frequently  communicate with a combination of ties across  similar and dissimilar entrepreneurs. Within  this exchange is a reiterative process of sharing  ideas and inspiration towards the creation of  the product. Further, data described an  innovation process that goes beyond the  conceptualisation of design. The synergistic  combining of resources and capacities also  lend to the innovation of mutually beneficial  processes by which small firms can achieve the  multiple goals of producing high quality, niche  products that meet a burgeoning demand  beyond their individual capacities. As a result,  participating entrepreneurs in the innovation  process would collaboratively secure a revenue  stream from which both draw income. These  ties of the ‘inner circle’ would vary in their  relational closeness, and range in perception as  ‘friends and family’ to the collegial but more  product-driven partnerships. Either way, these <p>distinct attributes of the clothing entrepreneur  constituted a dynamic innovation process  supported by the closeness of these diverse  relationships. On the other hand, data from  entrepreneurs in the service sector does not  speak of this on-going engagement of  collaborative creation. Their network structure  qualitatively – and hence visually - appears to  be more dispersed. Their ‘closest’ ties were  those with institutions and larger organisations.  Even in these relationships, the coded data  revealed only a moderate frequency of  interaction and very little on co-creation or  collaboration. Arguably, the innovation process  may be hampered by the established bureau- cracy of such organisations that allow limited  space for bargaining, negotiating, or creating  meaning of multiple sources of knowledge and  experience. Consequentially, such ties provide  the great value in presenting opportunities of  entering the industry by which a small  enterprise of emerging capacity, can become  an integrated component of an established  organisation’s value chain with a proven  competitive advantage. <p>Hence, the primary gain is that innovation is <p>a highly socially embedded process within a  network structure of close, diverse ties.  Moreover, the central argument posed that  qualitative,  intangible,  and  experiential <p>aspects of closeness – fostered by the structural  composition of closeness – is critical in  fostering the innovation process as well.  <p>The findings were generally supported by <p>the literature on networks and firm innovation.  Overall, the literature supports a generally  positive relationship between networks and  innovation, which Pittaway et al. (2004)  confirm through their comprehensive systematic  review of both conceptual and empirical  works. Tsai (2001) highlights that network  position does have a positive impact on  innovation, mediated by the actor’s capacity to  absorb the knowledge gained externally.  Lipparini & Sobrero (1994) bring particular  attention to small and medium enterprises, as  they argue that small enterprises can use their  relational capabilities to find new combinations  of  knowledge  and  further  competitive <p>advantage beyond the limitations of their size.  Similarly, this study confirms such insight by  exploring the interaction between network <p>structure and sector, while keeping the firm  size constant. Future studies that examine how  the link between the variation in firm size and  sector informs networks of innovation value  has useful implications for business develop- ment (Rogers, 2004). <p>The specific attention given to the structural <p>closeness of an entrepreneur’s network as an  innovation-enabling attribute resonates with  findings of those such as Schilling & Phelps  (2007), who emphasise the  reach  and  cluster of a firm’s relationships as significant  contributors to the innovation process. The  reach  - referring to the capacity to access  diverse actors and a wider array of knowledge,  and  cluster -  referring to the positioning of  nodes that permit the high degree of exchange  and information – bear semantic variation but  conceptual resemblance to the noted ideas of  diversity and closeness in this study. Swan,  Newell, Scarbrough, and Hislop, (1999) echo  the imminent value of having actors in spaces  of close proximity so as to facilitate consistent  engagement and exchange.  <p>Nonetheless, the ‘relational’ or ‘experiential’ <p>closeness that diverse actors of a network share  is a very distinct dimension from that of the  ‘structural’ closeness. This study would argue  that it is the structural closeness that creates  the environment conducive to the cultivation  of the relational closeness. And as mentioned,  this study argues that it is within this  qualitative, intangible experience of closeness  that the innovation between actors is spurred  and facilitated. Swan et al.’s (1999) study of  community-based networking affirms this  logic by highlighting the collaborative co- creation and negotiation of knowledge that  enables institutionally-defying innovation of  people working together. According to Blomqvist  & Levy (2006), this engagement demands the  prerequisite of a ‘collaborative capacity’ that  describes the genuine activation of trust,  commitment, and communication in participating  actors– in order to optimise the interactions  taking place in the network.  <p>Ahuja’s (2000) empirical work, however, <p>reminds us that different aspects of an  entrepreneur’s network can provide contradictory  aspects  to  an  entrepreneur’s  innovation <p>process. Although this was not a prevalent  theme that emerged from the data, a few <p>respondents occasionally mentioned a competitive,  rather  than  collegial,  attitude  between <p>entrepreneurs. This aspect was acknowledged  as a social and attitudinal dimension of the  entrepreneurial community that could influence  innovation in adverse ways and is worthy of  further exploration.  <p>The proposed argument presents alternative <p>insights to two respected assertions presented  in the economic sociology literature. First,  Granovetter’s  strength of weak ties  argument  has long been revered and is foundational in  the social embeddedness literature (1973).  Granovetter postulates that ties beyond one’s  immediate identity group, allow an actor to  access a variety of information that aids in  their economic advancement. The findings  from this study suggest that among micro- businesses in this emerging market setting,  different types of ties provide different types of  economic value, rather than asserting that one  type of tie has more economic value than  another (Ahuja, 2000). Hence, the qualitative  findings from this study suggest that close ties  – which would be considered ‘strong ties’ in  Granovetter’s study, and in turn, not as  economically potent –  actually  have innovation-  oriented value towards the economic success  of microenterprises. “Strong ties” of highly  perceived value and high frequency of  communication provide a space of continual  exchange, inspiration, and combined capacities  as all parts of the co-creation process.  <p>A second assertion of Abigail Barr (2002) <p>suggested that, in lieu of studying the network  use of Ghanaian manufacturing firms, there is  a difference depending upon the firm size. She  argues that large firms draw innovative value  from their networks, whereas small firms  ideally source security from their web of  relationships. The South African case presented  here argues that the dichotomy between  ‘secure’ and ‘innovative’ networks is to be  further interrogated. Rather, this study suggests  that the innovation process is  embedded  and  driven  by a sense of secure relationships –  those fueled by a high sense of trust,  relateability, and mutual respect.  <p>Such structural and relational emphasis of <p>closeness, and closeness with diverse nodes, as  a network attribute which promotes innovation  confirms  that  innovation  is  indeed  an <p>embedded process (Oerlemans, Meeus, &  Boekena, 1998). This study emphasises that  ‘closeness’ has a very distinct qualitative  interpretation in the relational understanding of  small enterprises’ networks beyond just  calculated distance or structural position.  “Closeness” captures an intangible and yet  extremely meaningful set of relational variables  that spark not only a sense of mutual  appreciation between people or organisations,  but moreover, the desire to work together, to  expose inner thoughts and ideas, to entrust to  each other future ambitions or current <p>struggles. It is a particular dimension of  relational capital that embodies the elements of  deep meaning and helps to create the  experiences and memories created by entities  every time they engage. And such ‘closeness’  depicts not only a static relational attribute, but  that which has the potential of converting into  economic value, as the ability to mutually  envision, design, and build translates into  collaborations around niche products, reputeable  brands, quality production, and operational  efficiency that gives a firm of any size an  endearing and competitive advantage.

              "' J. Adam  et al. (ALICE Collaboration) The properties of an extreme state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), are studied by colliding heavy ions at BNL ’ s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and at CERN ’ s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of the most widely utilized physical phenomena in the exploration of QGP properties is collective anisotropic flow  [1,2] . The large elliptic flow discovered at RHIC energies  [3] , which at the LHC energy of 2.76 TeV is 30% larger  [4]  and is recently reported in Ref.  [5]  to increase even further at 5.02 TeV, demonstrated that the QGP behaves like a strongly coupled liquid with a very small ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density,  η =s , which is close to a universal lower bound of  1 = 4 π  [6] . Anisotropic flow is traditionally quantified with harmonics  v  and corresponding symmetry plane angles ψ  in the Fourier series decomposition of the particle azimuthal distribution (parametrized with azimuthal angle φ ) in the plane transverse to the beam direction  [7] : dN d φ ∝  1  þ  2 X v  cos ½ n ð φ  −  ψ Þ� : ð 1 Þ The shape of the intersecting zone of two identical heavy ions in noncentral collisions is approximately ellipsoidal. This initial anisotropy is transferred via interactions among constituents and the pressure gradients developed in the QGP medium to an observable final-state anisotropic emission of particles with respect to the symmetry plane(s) of the intersecting zone. The resulting anisotropic flow for such an idealized ellipsoidal geometry is determined solely by even Fourier harmonics  v , and only one symmetry plane (the reaction plane) exists. Recently, the importance of flow fluctuations and related additional observables has been identified. This has led to new concepts such as nonvanishing odd harmonics  v  at midrapidity  [8] , nonidentical symmetry plane angles  ψ  and their intercorrelations  [9 – 14] , the stochastic nature of the harmonic v  and its probability density function  P ð v Þ  [15 – 20] , and, finally, the importance of higher order flow moments h v i  (where the angular brackets denote an average over all events, and  k  ≥  2 )  [21] . Two distinct regimes for anisotropic flow development are nowadays scrutinized separately: geometry dominated (in midcentral collisions) and fluctuation dominated (in the most central collisions)  [11] . Anisotropic flow is generated by the initial anisotropic geometry and its fluctuations coupled with an expansion of the produced medium. The initial coordinate space anisotropy can be quantified in terms of the eccentricity coefficients  ε  and the corresponding symmetry plane angles  Φ  [8,15,22] . A great deal of effort is being invested PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 0031-9007 = 16 = 117(18) = 182301(14) 182301-1 © 2016 CERN, for the ALICE Collaboration to understand the relations between the momentum space Fourier harmonics  v  and the symmetry planes  ψ  on one side, and their spatial counterparts  ε  and  Φ  on the other side. These relations describe the response of the produced system to the initial coordinate space anisotropies, and therefore provide a rich repository of constraints for the system properties. In the early studies it was regularly assumed that, for small eccentricities, the harmonics  v respond linearly to the eccentricities  ε  of the same order, v  ∝  ε , and that  ψ  ≃  Φ  [8,10,23,24] . However, for sizable eccentricities recent studies argue that the anisotropies in momentum and coordinate space are related instead with the matrix equation connecting a set of anisotropic flow harmonics  f v g  and a set of eccentricity coefficients  f ε g ; it was demonstrated that the hydrodynamic response is both nondiagonal and nonlinear, and that in general  ψ  ≠  Φ  [9,11,25,26] . The first realization led to the conclusion that a relationship between eventby-event fluctuations of the amplitudes of two different flow harmonics  v  and  v  can exist. This is hardly surprising for even flow harmonics in noncentral collisions because the ellipsoidal shape generates nonvanishing values for all even harmonics  v  [27] , not only for elliptic flow. However, this simple geometrical argument cannot explain the possible relation between the even and odd flow harmonics in noncentral collisions, and the argument is not applicable in the central collisions, where all initial shapes are equally probable since they originate solely from fluctuations. Recently a linear correlation coefficient  c ð a; b Þ  was defined in this context, which becomes 1 ( − 1 ) if observables  a  and  b  are fully linearly (antilinearly) correlated and zero in the absence of correlation  [25] . Model calculations of this new observable showed that neither  v  and  v  nor  v  and  v  are linearly correlated in noncentral collisions. Most importantly, it was demonstrated that c ð v ; v Þ depends strongly both on  η =s  of the QGP and on the value of c ð ε ;  ε Þ , which quantifies the relationship between corresponding eccentricities in the initial state [25] . Therefore, it was concluded that new observables c ð v ; v Þ , depending on the choice of flow harmonics v  and  v , are sensitive both to the fluctuations of the initial conditions and to the transport properties of the QGP, with the potential to discriminate between the two respective contributions when combined with a measurement of individual flow harmonics  [25] . In this Letter we study the relationship between eventby-event fluctuations of magnitudes of two different flow harmonics of order  n  and  m  by using a recently proposed four-particle observable  [28] : ⟪ cos ð m φ  þ  n φ  −  m φ  −  n φ Þ ⟫  ¼  ⟪ cos ð m φ  þ  n φ  −  m φ  −  n φ Þ ⟫ −  ⟪ cos ½ m ð φ  −  φ Þ� ⟫⟪ cos ½ n ð φ  −  φ Þ� ⟫ ¼ h v v i  −  h v ih v i ð 2 Þ with the condition  m  ≠  n  for two positive integers  m  and  n . We refer to these new observables as the symmetric twoharmonic four-particle cumulant, and use the notation SC ð m; n Þ , or just SC. The double angular brackets indicate that the averaging procedure has been performed in two steps — first, averaging over all distinct particle quadruplets in an event, and then in the second step weighting the singleevent averages with the  “ number of combinations. ”  The latter for single-event average four-particle correlations is mathematically equivalent to a unit weight for each individual quadrupletwhenthemultiplicitydifferseventbyevent [29] .In both two-particle correlators above all distinct particle pairs are considered in each case. The four-particle cumulant in Eq.  (2)  is less sensitive to nonflow correlations than any twoor four-particle correlator on the right-hand side taken individually  [30,31] . The last equality is true only in the absence of nonflow effects  [32] . The observable in Eq.  (2)  is zerointheabsenceofflowfluctuations,orifthemagnitudesof the harmonics  v  and  v  are uncorrelated  [28] . It is also unaffected by the relationship between the symmetry plane angles  ψ  and  ψ . The four-particle cumulant in Eq.  (2)  is proportional to the linear correlation coefficient  c ð a; b Þ introduced in Ref.  [25]  and discussed above, with  a  ¼  v and  b  ¼  v . Experimentally, it is more reliable to measure the higher order moments of the flow harmonics  v ð k  ≥  2 Þ  with twoand multiparticle correlation techniques  [31,33,34] , than to measure the first moments  v  with the event plane method, due to the systematic uncertainties involved in the event-by-event estimation of the symmetry planes  [35,36] . Therefore, we have used the new multiparticle observable in Eq.  (2)  as meant to be the least biased measure of the correlation between event-by-event fluctuations of magnitudes of the two different harmonics  v  and  v  [28] . The twoand four-particle correlations in Eq.  (2)  were evaluated in terms of  Q  vectors  [33] . The  Q  vector (or flow vector) in harmonic  n  for a set of  M  particles, where throughout this Letter  M  is the multiplicity of an event, is definedas Q  ≡ P e  [7,37] .Wehaveusedforasingleevent average two-particle correlation  h cos ð n ð φ  −  φ ÞÞi  the following definition and analytic result in terms of  Q  vectors: 1 ð Þ 2!

The data used in this analysis were obtained with the ALICE detector  [38,39] . They consist of minimum-bias Pb-Pb collisions recorded during the 2010 LHC Pb-Pb run at ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s p ¼  2 . 76  TeV. With the default event and track selection criteria described below, we have obtained in total about  1 . 8  ×  10 events per 1% centrality bin width. All individual systematic variations were combined in quadrature to obtain the final uncertainty. The centrality was determined with the V0 detector [40 – 42] . As a part of systematic checks the centrality was determined independently with the time projection chamber (TPC)  [43]  and the silicon pixel detector  [44,45] , which have slightly worse resolution  [42] . A systematic difference of up to 3% was observed in the SC ð m; n Þ  results when using different centrality estimations. Charged particles were reconstructed with the TPC and the inner tracking system  [44,45]  immersed in a 0.5 T solenoidal field. The TPC is capable of detecting charged particles in the transverse momentum range  0 . 1  < p  <  100  GeV =c , with a  p  resolution of less than 6% for tracks below  20  GeV =c . Because of TPC dead zones between neighboring sectors, the track finding efficiency is about 75% for  p  ¼ 200  MeV =c  and then it saturates at about 85% for  p  > 1  GeV =c  in Pb-Pb collisions. The TPC covers the full azimuth and has a pseudorapidity coverage of  j η j  <  0 . 9 . Tracks reconstructed using the TPC and inner tracking system are referred to as global, while tracks reconstructed only with the TPC are referred to as TPC only. For online triggering, the V0 and silicon pixel detectors were used  [39] . The reconstructed primary vertex is required to lie within  � 10  cm of the nominal interaction point in the longitudinal direction along the beam axis. The cut on the position of the primary vertex along the beam axis was varied from  � 12  to  � 6  cm; the resulting SC measurements are consistent with those obtained with the default cut. The main analysis was performed with global tracks selected in the transverse momentum interval  0 . 2  < p  < 5 . 0  GeV =c  and the pseudorapidity region  j η j  <  0 . 8 . With this choice of a low  p  cutoff we are reducing event-byevent biases from a smaller reconstruction efficiency at lower  p , while the high  p  cutoff was introduced to reduce the contribution to the anisotropies from the jets. Reconstructed tracks were required to have at least 70 TPC space points (out of a maximum of 159). Only tracks with a transverse distance of closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex less than 3 mm are accepted to reduce the contamination from secondary tracks. Tracks with kinks (the tracks that appear to change direction due to multiple scattering,  K decays) were rejected. An independent analysis was performed with TPC-only and hybrid tracks (see below). For TPC-only tracks, the DCA cut was relaxed to 3 cm, providing a different sensitivity to contamination from the secondary tracks. Both the azimuthal acceptance and the reconstruction efficiency as a function of transverse momentum differ between the TPC-only and global tracks. The resulting difference between independent analyses with global and TPC-only tracks was found to be 1% – 5% in all the centrality ranges studied, both for SC(3,2) and SC(4,2). In another independent analysis with hybrid tracks, three different types of tracks were combined, in order to overcome the nonuniform azimuthal acceptance due to dead zones in the silicon pixel detector, and to achieve the best transverse momentum resolution  [39] . In this analysis the DCA cut was set to 3.2 cm in the longitudinal and to 2.4 cm in the transverse direction. The results between the global and hybrid tracks differ by 3% to 5%, depending on the observable considered. One of the largest contributions to the systematic uncertainty originates from the nonuniform reconstruction efficiency as a function of transverse momentum. For the observables SC(3,2) and SC(4,2) the uncertainty is 7% and 8%, respectively. In order to correct the measurements of these azimuthal correlators for various detector inefficiencies, we have constructed the particle weights as a function of azimuthal angle  φ  and transverse momentum  p , and used the prescription outlined in Ref.  [28] . In particular,  p weights were constructed as a ratio of the transverse momentum distribution obtained from Monte Carlo generated tracks and from tracks reconstructed after they have passed through the detector simulated with 3  [46] . We have used four Monte Carlo models in this Letter. The HIJING model  [47,48]  was utilized to obtain the  p weights  [28] . Second, the  model was used to estimate the strength of the nonflow correlations (typically few-particle correlations insensitive to the collision geometry). We have evaluated the observables of interest in coordinate space by modeling the initial conditions with a Monte Carlo Glauber model  [49] . We have compared the PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-3 centrality dependence of our observables with the theoretical model from Ref.  [50] , where the initial energy density profiles are calculated using a next-to-leading order perturbative-QCD+saturation model  [51,52] . The subsequent spacetime evolution is described by relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics with different parametrizations for the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio  η =s ð T Þ . Each of the  η =s ð T Þ  parametrizations is adjusted to reproduce the measured  v  from central to midperipheral collisions. Finally, we provide an independent estimate of the centrality dependence of our observables by utilizing the  model  [53] . The centrality dependence of SC(4,2) (red squares) and SC(3,2) (blue circles) is presented in Fig.  1 . Positive values of SC(4,2) are observed for all centralities. This suggests a correlation between the event-by-event fluctuations of  v and  v , which indicates that finding  v  larger than  h v i  in an event enhances the probability of finding  v  larger than h v i  in that event. On the other hand, the negative results of SC(3,2) show the anticorrelation between the  v  and  v magnitudes, which further imply that finding  v  larger than h v i  enhances the probability of finding  v  smaller than h v i . We have calculated the SC observables using , which does not include anisotropic collectivity but, e.g., azimuthal correlations due to jet production  [47,48] . It is found that in  both  ⟪ cos ð m φ þ n φ − m φ  − n φ Þ ⟫ and  ⟪ cos ½ m ð φ − φ Þ� ⟫⟪ cos ½ n ð φ − φ Þ� ⟫  are nonzero. However, the calculated SC observables from  are compatible with zero for all centralities, which suggests that the SC measurements are nearly insensitive to nonflow correlations. We have also performed a study using the likesign technique, which is another powerful approach to estimate the nonflow effects  [4] . It was found that the difference between the correlations for like-sign and all charged combinations is within 10%. This demonstrates that nonzero values of SC measurements cannot be explained by nonflow effects. A study based on the  model showed that the observed (anti)correlations are also sensitive to the transport properties, e.g., the partonic and hadronic interactions [20,28] . Figure  2  shows the comparison of SC(3,2) and PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-4 SC(4,2) to the  calculations, which generally predict the correct sign but underestimate their magnitude. The comparison between experimental data and the theoretical calculations  [50] , which incorporate both the initial conditions and the system evolution, is shown in Fig.  2  (top). The model captures qualitatively the centrality dependence, but not quantitatively. Most notably, there is no single centrality for which a given  η =s ð T Þ  parametrization describes simultaneously both SC(4,2) and SC(3,2). On the other hand, the same theoretical model captures quantitatively the centrality dependence of the individual v ,  v , and  v  harmonics with a precision better than 10% in the central and midcentral collisions  [50] . We therefore conclude that the individual flow harmonics  v  and new SC ð m; n Þ  observables together provide a better handle on the initial conditions and  η =s ð T Þ  than each of them alone. This is emphasized in Fig.  2  (middle), where the SC(3,2) and SC(4,2) observables were divided with the products h v ih v i  and  h v ih v i , respectively, in order to obtain the normalized SC observables (the result for 60% – 70% is omitted due to the large statistical uncertainty). These products were obtained with two-particle correlations and using a pseudorapidity gap of  j Δ η j  >  1 . 0  to suppress biases from few-particle nonflow correlations. We have found that the normalized SC(4,2) observable exhibits much better sensitivity to different  η =s ð T Þ  parametrizations than the normalized SC(3,2) observable, see Fig.  2 (middle), and than the individual flow harmonics  [50] . These findings indicate that the normalized SC(3,2) observable is sensitive mainly to the initial conditions, while the normalized SC(4,2) observable is sensitive to both the initial conditions and the system properties, which is consistent with the prediction from Ref.  [25] . It can be seen in Fig.  1  that SC(4,2) and SC(3,2) increase nonlinearly up to centrality 60%. Assuming only a linear response,  v  ∝  ε , we expect that the normalized SC ð m; n Þ evaluated in coordinate space can capture the measurement of the centrality dependence of the normalized SC ð m; n Þ  in the momentum space. The correlations between the  n th and  m th order harmonics were estimated with calculations of  ðh ε ε i  −  h ε ih ε iÞ = h ε ih ε i , i.e., a normalized SC observable in the coordinate space, which we denote SC ð m; n Þ = h ε ih ε i . Here,  ε  ( ε ) is the  n th ( m th) order coordinate space anisotropy, following the definition in Ref.  [8] . Different scenarios of the Monte Carlo Glauber model, named the wounded nucleon and binary collision weights, have been used. An increasing trend from central to peripheral collisions with different sign has been observed in Fig.  2  (bottom) for SC(4,2) and SC(3,2). A dramatic deviation of SC(4,2) between data and the model calculation is observed for noncentral collisions. This deviation increases from midcentral to peripheral, which could be understood as the contribution of the nonlinear response ( ε  contributes to  v ) increasing as a function of centrality, which is consistent with that reported in Ref.  [54] . Since the normalized SC(3,2) appears to be sensitive only to the initial conditions and not to  η =s ð T Þ , see Fig.  2  (middle), the Monte Carlo Glauber model captures better its centrality dependence than it does for the normalized SC(4,2) observable, see Fig.  2  (bottom). The relationship between the flow harmonics  v ,  v ,  v has also been investigated by the ATLAS Collaboration using the event shape engineering technique  [54 – 56] . For events with a larger  v , the ATLAS Collaboration showed these have a smaller than average  v , and a larger than average  v . For events with a smaller  v , the opposite trend occurred. These observations are consistent with the patterns observed via the SC measurements presented in this Letter. The SC observables, however, provide a compact quantitative measure of these correlations, without fitting correlations between  v  and  v . This simplifies the quantitative comparison of the SC observables with hydrodynamical calculations as shown in Fig.  2 . In the most central collisions the anisotropies originate mainly from fluctuations; i.e., the initial ellipsoidal PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-5 geometry characteristic for midcentral collisions plays little role in this regime. Therefore, we have performed a separate analysis for the centrality range 0% – 10% in centrality bins of 1%. The results are presented in Fig.  3 . We observe that event-by-event fluctuations of  v and  v  remain correlated, and of  v  and  v  anticorrelated, also in this regime. However, the strength of the (anti) correlations exhibits a different centrality dependence than for the wider centrality range shown in Fig.  1 . As seen in Fig.  3  (top) the centrality dependence cannot be linearly extrapolated from the 0% – 10% region to the full centrality range. Comparison with the two different parametrizations of the Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions for the normalized SC observables presented in Fig.  3  (bottom) suggests that the binary collision parametrization (binary collision weights) is favored by the data in most central collisions. This agreement may suggest the scaling with the number of quark participants  [57 – 61]  in central collisions at the LHC energies. In summary, we have measured for the first time the new multiparticle observables, the symmetric two-harmonic four-particle cumulants, which quantify the relationship between the event-by-event fluctuations of two different flow harmonics. We have found that the fluctuations of  v and  v  are anticorrelated in all centralities; however, the details of the centrality dependence differ in the fluctutation-dominated (most central) and the geometry-dominated (midcentral) regimes. The fluctuations of  v  and  v  are correlated for all centralities. The SC observables were used to discriminate between the state-of-the-art hydro model calculations with different parametrizations of the temperature dependence of  η =s , for all of which the centrality dependence of elliptic, triangular, and quadrangular flow has a weaker sensitivity at the LHC. In particular, the centrality dependence of SC(4,2) cannot be captured with the constant  η =s . We have also used our results to discriminate between two different parametrizations of the initial conditions and have demonstrated that in the fluctuation-dominated regime (in central collisions) the Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions with binary collision weights are favored over wounded nucleon weights.

              "' J. Adam  et al. (ALICE Collaboration) The properties of an extreme state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), are studied by colliding heavy ions at BNL ’ s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and at CERN ’ s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of the most widely utilized physical phenomena in the exploration of QGP properties is collective anisotropic flow  [1,2] . The large elliptic flow discovered at RHIC energies  [3] , which at the LHC energy of 2.76 TeV is 30% larger  [4]  and is recently reported in Ref.  [5]  to increase even further at 5.02 TeV, demonstrated that the QGP behaves like a strongly coupled liquid with a very small ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density,  η =s , which is close to a universal lower bound of  1 = 4 π  [6] . Anisotropic flow is traditionally quantified with harmonics  v  and corresponding symmetry plane angles ψ  in the Fourier series decomposition of the particle azimuthal distribution (parametrized with azimuthal angle φ ) in the plane transverse to the beam direction  [7] : dN d φ ∝  1  þ  2 X v  cos ½ n ð φ  −  ψ Þ� : ð 1 Þ The shape of the intersecting zone of two identical heavy ions in noncentral collisions is approximately ellipsoidal. This initial anisotropy is transferred via interactions among constituents and the pressure gradients developed in the QGP medium to an observable final-state anisotropic emission of particles with respect to the symmetry plane(s) of the intersecting zone. The resulting anisotropic flow for such an idealized ellipsoidal geometry is determined solely by even Fourier harmonics  v , and only one symmetry plane (the reaction plane) exists. Recently, the importance of flow fluctuations and related additional observables has been identified. This has led to new concepts such as nonvanishing odd harmonics  v  at midrapidity  [8] , nonidentical symmetry plane angles  ψ  and their intercorrelations  [9 – 14] , the stochastic nature of the harmonic v  and its probability density function  P ð v Þ  [15 – 20] , and, finally, the importance of higher order flow moments h v i  (where the angular brackets denote an average over all events, and  k  ≥  2 )  [21] . Two distinct regimes for anisotropic flow development are nowadays scrutinized separately: geometry dominated (in midcentral collisions) and fluctuation dominated (in the most central collisions)  [11] . Anisotropic flow is generated by the initial anisotropic geometry and its fluctuations coupled with an expansion of the produced medium. The initial coordinate space anisotropy can be quantified in terms of the eccentricity coefficients  ε  and the corresponding symmetry plane angles  Φ  [8,15,22] . A great deal of effort is being invested PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 0031-9007 = 16 = 117(18) = 182301(14) 182301-1 © 2016 CERN, for the ALICE Collaboration to understand the relations between the momentum space Fourier harmonics  v  and the symmetry planes  ψ  on one side, and their spatial counterparts  ε  and  Φ  on the other side. These relations describe the response of the produced system to the initial coordinate space anisotropies, and therefore provide a rich repository of constraints for the system properties. In the early studies it was regularly assumed that, for small eccentricities, the harmonics  v respond linearly to the eccentricities  ε  of the same order, v  ∝  ε , and that  ψ  ≃  Φ  [8,10,23,24] . However, for sizable eccentricities recent studies argue that the anisotropies in momentum and coordinate space are related instead with the matrix equation connecting a set of anisotropic flow harmonics  f v g  and a set of eccentricity coefficients  f ε g ; it was demonstrated that the hydrodynamic response is both nondiagonal and nonlinear, and that in general  ψ  ≠  Φ  [9,11,25,26] . The first realization led to the conclusion that a relationship between eventby-event fluctuations of the amplitudes of two different flow harmonics  v  and  v  can exist. This is hardly surprising for even flow harmonics in noncentral collisions because the ellipsoidal shape generates nonvanishing values for all even harmonics  v  [27] , not only for elliptic flow. However, this simple geometrical argument cannot explain the possible relation between the even and odd flow harmonics in noncentral collisions, and the argument is not applicable in the central collisions, where all initial shapes are equally probable since they originate solely from fluctuations. Recently a linear correlation coefficient  c ð a; b Þ  was defined in this context, which becomes 1 ( − 1 ) if observables  a  and  b  are fully linearly (antilinearly) correlated and zero in the absence of correlation  [25] . Model calculations of this new observable showed that neither  v  and  v  nor  v  and  v  are linearly correlated in noncentral collisions. Most importantly, it was demonstrated that c ð v ; v Þ depends strongly both on  η =s  of the QGP and on the value of c ð ε ;  ε Þ , which quantifies the relationship between corresponding eccentricities in the initial state [25] . Therefore, it was concluded that new observables c ð v ; v Þ , depending on the choice of flow harmonics v  and  v , are sensitive both to the fluctuations of the initial conditions and to the transport properties of the QGP, with the potential to discriminate between the two respective contributions when combined with a measurement of individual flow harmonics  [25] . In this Letter we study the relationship between eventby-event fluctuations of magnitudes of two different flow harmonics of order  n  and  m  by using a recently proposed four-particle observable  [28] : ⟪ cos ð m φ  þ  n φ  −  m φ  −  n φ Þ ⟫  ¼  ⟪ cos ð m φ  þ  n φ  −  m φ  −  n φ Þ ⟫ −  ⟪ cos ½ m ð φ  −  φ Þ� ⟫⟪ cos ½ n ð φ  −  φ Þ� ⟫ ¼ h v v i  −  h v ih v i ð 2 Þ with the condition  m  ≠  n  for two positive integers  m  and  n . We refer to these new observables as the symmetric twoharmonic four-particle cumulant, and use the notation SC ð m; n Þ , or just SC. The double angular brackets indicate that the averaging procedure has been performed in two steps — first, averaging over all distinct particle quadruplets in an event, and then in the second step weighting the singleevent averages with the  “ number of combinations. ”  The latter for single-event average four-particle correlations is mathematically equivalent to a unit weight for each individual quadrupletwhenthemultiplicitydifferseventbyevent [29] .In both two-particle correlators above all distinct particle pairs are considered in each case. The four-particle cumulant in Eq.  (2)  is less sensitive to nonflow correlations than any twoor four-particle correlator on the right-hand side taken individually  [30,31] . The last equality is true only in the absence of nonflow effects  [32] . The observable in Eq.  (2)  is zerointheabsenceofflowfluctuations,orifthemagnitudesof the harmonics  v  and  v  are uncorrelated  [28] . It is also unaffected by the relationship between the symmetry plane angles  ψ  and  ψ . The four-particle cumulant in Eq.  (2)  is proportional to the linear correlation coefficient  c ð a; b Þ introduced in Ref.  [25]  and discussed above, with  a  ¼  v and  b  ¼  v . Experimentally, it is more reliable to measure the higher order moments of the flow harmonics  v ð k  ≥  2 Þ  with twoand multiparticle correlation techniques  [31,33,34] , than to measure the first moments  v  with the event plane method, due to the systematic uncertainties involved in the event-by-event estimation of the symmetry planes  [35,36] . Therefore, we have used the new multiparticle observable in Eq.  (2)  as meant to be the least biased measure of the correlation between event-by-event fluctuations of magnitudes of the two different harmonics  v  and  v  [28] . The twoand four-particle correlations in Eq.  (2)  were evaluated in terms of  Q  vectors  [33] . The  Q  vector (or flow vector) in harmonic  n  for a set of  M  particles, where throughout this Letter  M  is the multiplicity of an event, is definedas Q  ≡ P e  [7,37] .Wehaveusedforasingleevent average two-particle correlation  h cos ð n ð φ  −  φ ÞÞi  the following definition and analytic result in terms of  Q  vectors: 1 ð Þ 2!

The data used in this analysis were obtained with the ALICE detector  [38,39] . They consist of minimum-bias Pb-Pb collisions recorded during the 2010 LHC Pb-Pb run at ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s p ¼  2 . 76  TeV. With the default event and track selection criteria described below, we have obtained in total about  1 . 8  ×  10 events per 1% centrality bin width. All individual systematic variations were combined in quadrature to obtain the final uncertainty. The centrality was determined with the V0 detector [40 – 42] . As a part of systematic checks the centrality was determined independently with the time projection chamber (TPC)  [43]  and the silicon pixel detector  [44,45] , which have slightly worse resolution  [42] . A systematic difference of up to 3% was observed in the SC ð m; n Þ  results when using different centrality estimations. Charged particles were reconstructed with the TPC and the inner tracking system  [44,45]  immersed in a 0.5 T solenoidal field. The TPC is capable of detecting charged particles in the transverse momentum range  0 . 1  < p  <  100  GeV =c , with a  p  resolution of less than 6% for tracks below  20  GeV =c . Because of TPC dead zones between neighboring sectors, the track finding efficiency is about 75% for  p  ¼ 200  MeV =c  and then it saturates at about 85% for  p  > 1  GeV =c  in Pb-Pb collisions. The TPC covers the full azimuth and has a pseudorapidity coverage of  j η j  <  0 . 9 . Tracks reconstructed using the TPC and inner tracking system are referred to as global, while tracks reconstructed only with the TPC are referred to as TPC only. For online triggering, the V0 and silicon pixel detectors were used  [39] . The reconstructed primary vertex is required to lie within  � 10  cm of the nominal interaction point in the longitudinal direction along the beam axis. The cut on the position of the primary vertex along the beam axis was varied from  � 12  to  � 6  cm; the resulting SC measurements are consistent with those obtained with the default cut. The main analysis was performed with global tracks selected in the transverse momentum interval  0 . 2  < p  < 5 . 0  GeV =c  and the pseudorapidity region  j η j  <  0 . 8 . With this choice of a low  p  cutoff we are reducing event-byevent biases from a smaller reconstruction efficiency at lower  p , while the high  p  cutoff was introduced to reduce the contribution to the anisotropies from the jets. Reconstructed tracks were required to have at least 70 TPC space points (out of a maximum of 159). Only tracks with a transverse distance of closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex less than 3 mm are accepted to reduce the contamination from secondary tracks. Tracks with kinks (the tracks that appear to change direction due to multiple scattering,  K decays) were rejected. An independent analysis was performed with TPC-only and hybrid tracks (see below). For TPC-only tracks, the DCA cut was relaxed to 3 cm, providing a different sensitivity to contamination from the secondary tracks. Both the azimuthal acceptance and the reconstruction efficiency as a function of transverse momentum differ between the TPC-only and global tracks. The resulting difference between independent analyses with global and TPC-only tracks was found to be 1% – 5% in all the centrality ranges studied, both for SC(3,2) and SC(4,2). In another independent analysis with hybrid tracks, three different types of tracks were combined, in order to overcome the nonuniform azimuthal acceptance due to dead zones in the silicon pixel detector, and to achieve the best transverse momentum resolution  [39] . In this analysis the DCA cut was set to 3.2 cm in the longitudinal and to 2.4 cm in the transverse direction. The results between the global and hybrid tracks differ by 3% to 5%, depending on the observable considered. One of the largest contributions to the systematic uncertainty originates from the nonuniform reconstruction efficiency as a function of transverse momentum. For the observables SC(3,2) and SC(4,2) the uncertainty is 7% and 8%, respectively. In order to correct the measurements of these azimuthal correlators for various detector inefficiencies, we have constructed the particle weights as a function of azimuthal angle  φ  and transverse momentum  p , and used the prescription outlined in Ref.  [28] . In particular,  p weights were constructed as a ratio of the transverse momentum distribution obtained from Monte Carlo generated tracks and from tracks reconstructed after they have passed through the detector simulated with 3  [46] . We have used four Monte Carlo models in this Letter. The HIJING model  [47,48]  was utilized to obtain the  p weights  [28] . Second, the  model was used to estimate the strength of the nonflow correlations (typically few-particle correlations insensitive to the collision geometry). We have evaluated the observables of interest in coordinate space by modeling the initial conditions with a Monte Carlo Glauber model  [49] . We have compared the PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-3 centrality dependence of our observables with the theoretical model from Ref.  [50] , where the initial energy density profiles are calculated using a next-to-leading order perturbative-QCD+saturation model  [51,52] . The subsequent spacetime evolution is described by relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics with different parametrizations for the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio  η =s ð T Þ . Each of the  η =s ð T Þ  parametrizations is adjusted to reproduce the measured  v  from central to midperipheral collisions. Finally, we provide an independent estimate of the centrality dependence of our observables by utilizing the  model  [53] . The centrality dependence of SC(4,2) (red squares) and SC(3,2) (blue circles) is presented in Fig.  1 . Positive values of SC(4,2) are observed for all centralities. This suggests a correlation between the event-by-event fluctuations of  v and  v , which indicates that finding  v  larger than  h v i  in an event enhances the probability of finding  v  larger than h v i  in that event. On the other hand, the negative results of SC(3,2) show the anticorrelation between the  v  and  v magnitudes, which further imply that finding  v  larger than h v i  enhances the probability of finding  v  smaller than h v i . We have calculated the SC observables using , which does not include anisotropic collectivity but, e.g., azimuthal correlations due to jet production  [47,48] . It is found that in  both  ⟪ cos ð m φ þ n φ − m φ  − n φ Þ ⟫ and  ⟪ cos ½ m ð φ − φ Þ� ⟫⟪ cos ½ n ð φ − φ Þ� ⟫  are nonzero. However, the calculated SC observables from  are compatible with zero for all centralities, which suggests that the SC measurements are nearly insensitive to nonflow correlations. We have also performed a study using the likesign technique, which is another powerful approach to estimate the nonflow effects  [4] . It was found that the difference between the correlations for like-sign and all charged combinations is within 10%. This demonstrates that nonzero values of SC measurements cannot be explained by nonflow effects. A study based on the  model showed that the observed (anti)correlations are also sensitive to the transport properties, e.g., the partonic and hadronic interactions [20,28] . Figure  2  shows the comparison of SC(3,2) and PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-4 SC(4,2) to the  calculations, which generally predict the correct sign but underestimate their magnitude. The comparison between experimental data and the theoretical calculations  [50] , which incorporate both the initial conditions and the system evolution, is shown in Fig.  2  (top). The model captures qualitatively the centrality dependence, but not quantitatively. Most notably, there is no single centrality for which a given  η =s ð T Þ  parametrization describes simultaneously both SC(4,2) and SC(3,2). On the other hand, the same theoretical model captures quantitatively the centrality dependence of the individual v ,  v , and  v  harmonics with a precision better than 10% in the central and midcentral collisions  [50] . We therefore conclude that the individual flow harmonics  v  and new SC ð m; n Þ  observables together provide a better handle on the initial conditions and  η =s ð T Þ  than each of them alone. This is emphasized in Fig.  2  (middle), where the SC(3,2) and SC(4,2) observables were divided with the products h v ih v i  and  h v ih v i , respectively, in order to obtain the normalized SC observables (the result for 60% – 70% is omitted due to the large statistical uncertainty). These products were obtained with two-particle correlations and using a pseudorapidity gap of  j Δ η j  >  1 . 0  to suppress biases from few-particle nonflow correlations. We have found that the normalized SC(4,2) observable exhibits much better sensitivity to different  η =s ð T Þ  parametrizations than the normalized SC(3,2) observable, see Fig.  2 (middle), and than the individual flow harmonics  [50] . These findings indicate that the normalized SC(3,2) observable is sensitive mainly to the initial conditions, while the normalized SC(4,2) observable is sensitive to both the initial conditions and the system properties, which is consistent with the prediction from Ref.  [25] . It can be seen in Fig.  1  that SC(4,2) and SC(3,2) increase nonlinearly up to centrality 60%. Assuming only a linear response,  v  ∝  ε , we expect that the normalized SC ð m; n Þ evaluated in coordinate space can capture the measurement of the centrality dependence of the normalized SC ð m; n Þ  in the momentum space. The correlations between the  n th and  m th order harmonics were estimated with calculations of  ðh ε ε i  −  h ε ih ε iÞ = h ε ih ε i , i.e., a normalized SC observable in the coordinate space, which we denote SC ð m; n Þ = h ε ih ε i . Here,  ε  ( ε ) is the  n th ( m th) order coordinate space anisotropy, following the definition in Ref.  [8] . Different scenarios of the Monte Carlo Glauber model, named the wounded nucleon and binary collision weights, have been used. An increasing trend from central to peripheral collisions with different sign has been observed in Fig.  2  (bottom) for SC(4,2) and SC(3,2). A dramatic deviation of SC(4,2) between data and the model calculation is observed for noncentral collisions. This deviation increases from midcentral to peripheral, which could be understood as the contribution of the nonlinear response ( ε  contributes to  v ) increasing as a function of centrality, which is consistent with that reported in Ref.  [54] . Since the normalized SC(3,2) appears to be sensitive only to the initial conditions and not to  η =s ð T Þ , see Fig.  2  (middle), the Monte Carlo Glauber model captures better its centrality dependence than it does for the normalized SC(4,2) observable, see Fig.  2  (bottom). The relationship between the flow harmonics  v ,  v ,  v has also been investigated by the ATLAS Collaboration using the event shape engineering technique  [54 – 56] . For events with a larger  v , the ATLAS Collaboration showed these have a smaller than average  v , and a larger than average  v . For events with a smaller  v , the opposite trend occurred. These observations are consistent with the patterns observed via the SC measurements presented in this Letter. The SC observables, however, provide a compact quantitative measure of these correlations, without fitting correlations between  v  and  v . This simplifies the quantitative comparison of the SC observables with hydrodynamical calculations as shown in Fig.  2 . In the most central collisions the anisotropies originate mainly from fluctuations; i.e., the initial ellipsoidal PRL  117,  182301 (2016) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 182301-5 geometry characteristic for midcentral collisions plays little role in this regime. Therefore, we have performed a separate analysis for the centrality range 0% – 10% in centrality bins of 1%. The results are presented in Fig.  3 . We observe that event-by-event fluctuations of  v and  v  remain correlated, and of  v  and  v  anticorrelated, also in this regime. However, the strength of the (anti) correlations exhibits a different centrality dependence than for the wider centrality range shown in Fig.  1 . As seen in Fig.  3  (top) the centrality dependence cannot be linearly extrapolated from the 0% – 10% region to the full centrality range. Comparison with the two different parametrizations of the Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions for the normalized SC observables presented in Fig.  3  (bottom) suggests that the binary collision parametrization (binary collision weights) is favored by the data in most central collisions. This agreement may suggest the scaling with the number of quark participants  [57 – 61]  in central collisions at the LHC energies. In summary, we have measured for the first time the new multiparticle observables, the symmetric two-harmonic four-particle cumulants, which quantify the relationship between the event-by-event fluctuations of two different flow harmonics. We have found that the fluctuations of  v and  v  are anticorrelated in all centralities; however, the details of the centrality dependence differ in the fluctutation-dominated (most central) and the geometry-dominated (midcentral) regimes. The fluctuations of  v  and  v  are correlated for all centralities. The SC observables were used to discriminate between the state-of-the-art hydro model calculations with different parametrizations of the temperature dependence of  η =s , for all of which the centrality dependence of elliptic, triangular, and quadrangular flow has a weaker sensitivity at the LHC. In particular, the centrality dependence of SC(4,2) cannot be captured with the constant  η =s . We have also used our results to discriminate between two different parametrizations of the initial conditions and have demonstrated that in the fluctuation-dominated regime (in central collisions) the Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions with binary collision weights are favored over wounded nucleon weights.

              "' M. Aaboud  et al. (ATLAS Collaboration) I. INTRODUCTION Events with an energetic jet and large missing transverse momentum  ~p (with magnitude  E ) in the final state constitute a clean and distinctive signature in searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) at colliders. Such signatures are referred to as monojetlike in this paper. In particular, monojet (as well as monophoton and monoW=Z ) final states have been studied at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  [1 – 15]  in the context of searches for large extra spatial dimensions (LED), supersymmetry (SUSY), and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as candidates for dark matter. The Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model for LED  [16]  explains the large difference between the electroweak unification scale at  O ð 10 Þ  GeV and the Planck scale  M  ∼  O ð 10 Þ  GeV by postulating the presence of  n  extra spatial dimensions of size  R , and defining a fundamental Planck scale in  4  þ  n  dimensions,  M , given by  M ∼  M R . An appropriate choice of  R  for a given  n  yields a value of  M  at the electroweak scale. The extra spatial dimensions are compactified, resulting in a Kaluza – Klein tower of massive graviton modes. If produced in high-energy collisions in association with an energetic jet, these graviton modes escape detection leading to a monojetlike signature in the final state. Supersymmetry  [17 – 25]  is a theory for physics beyond the SM that naturally solves the hierarchy problem and provides a possible candidate for dark matter in the Universe. SUSY enlarges the SM spectrum of particles by introducing a new supersymmetric partner (sparticle) for each particle in the SM. In particular, a new scalar field is associated with each leftor right-handed quark state and, ignoring intergenerational mixing, two squark mass eigenstates  ~ q  and  ~ q  result from the mixing of the scalar fields for a particular flavor. In some SUSY scenarios, a significant mass difference between the two eigenstates in the bottom squark (sbottom) and top squark (stop) sectors can occur, leading to rather light sbottom ~ b  and stop ~ t  mass states. In addition, naturalness arguments suggest that the third generation squarks should be light, with masses below about 1 TeV [26] . In a generic supersymmetric extension of the SM that assumes R-parity conservation  [27 – 31] , sparticles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. In this paper the LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino ~ χ . The results from the monojetlike analysis are interpreted in terms of searches for squark production using simplified models in compressed scenarios for which the mass difference  Δ m  ≡  m  −  m is small. Three separate processes are considered: stop pair production, where the stop decays to a charm quark and the LSP ( ~ t  →  c  þ  ~ χ ); sbottom pair production with ~ b  →  b  þ  ~ χ ; and squark pair production, with  ~ q  →  q  þ  ~ χ ð q  ¼  u; d; c; s Þ . For relatively small  Δ m , both the transverse momenta of the quark jets and the  E in the final state are low, making it difficult to extract the signal from the large multijet background. In this study, the event selection makes use of the presence of initial-state radiation jets to identify signal events (see Fig.  1 , left). In this case, the squark-pair system is boosted, leading to larger  E . A nonbaryonic dark matter component in the Universe is commonly used to explain a range of astrophysical measurements (see, for example, Ref.  [32]  for a review). Since none of the SM particles are adequate dark matter candidates, the existence of a new particle is often hypothesized. Weakly interacting massive particles are one such class of particle candidates  [33]  that can be searched for at the LHC. Such a new particle would result in the correct relic density values for nonrelativistic matter in the early Universe  [34] , as measured by the Planck  [35]  and WMAP  [36]  satellites, if its mass is between a few GeV and one TeV and if it has electroweak-scale interaction cross sections. Many new particle-physics models such as SUSY  [17 – 25]  also predict WIMPs. In contrast to the Run-1 analyses with the monojetlike final state  [37] , the results of this analysis are not interpreted in terms of the effective-field-theory models [38] . Simplified models are used instead, providing a more complete framework that involves new mediator particles between the SM and the dark sector  [39 – 42] . The predictions from simplified models coincide with those obtained by using an effective-field-theory approach when the mediator mass considered is above 10 TeV  [43] . Here a model with an  s -channel exchange of a spin-1 mediator particle with axial-vector couplings is considered, connecting the quarks to WIMPs of a Dirac fermion type. This is referred to as a leptophobic  Z -like model, and is defined by four free parameters: the WIMP mass  m , the mediator mass  m , the coupling of the mediator to WIMPs ( g ) and the flavor-universal coupling to quarks ( g ). Couplings to other SM particles are not allowed and the minimal mediator width is taken, defined in accord with Ref.  [41]  as Γ  ¼ g m 12 π  β θ ð m  −  2 m Þ þ X 3 g m 12 π  β θ ð m  −  2 m Þ ; ð 1 Þ where  θ ð x Þ  denotes the Heaviside step function and  β  ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1  − r is the velocity of the fermion  f  with mass  m  in the mediator rest frame. The sum runs over all quark flavors. The monojetlike signature in this model emerges from initial-state radiation of a gluon as shown in Fig.  1  (right). The paper is organized as follows. The ATLAS detector is described in the next section. Section  III  provides details of the simulations used in the analysis for background and signal processes. Section  IV  discusses the reconstruction of jets, leptons, and missing transverse momentum, while Sec.  V  describes the event selection. The estimation of background contributions and the study of systematic uncertainties are discussed in Secs.  VI  and  VII . The results are presented in Sec.  VIII  and are interpreted in terms of limits in models for ADD LED, SUSY in compressed scenarios, and WIMP pair production. Finally, Sec.  IX  is devoted to the conclusions. II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The ATLAS detector  [44]  covers almost the whole solid angle around the collision point with layers of tracking detectors, calorimeters, and muon chambers. The ATLAS inner detector covers the pseudorapidity range  j η j  <  2 . 5 . It consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector, and a straw tube tracker that also measures transition radiation for particle identification, all immersed in a 2 Taxial magnetic field produced by a solenoid. During the first LHC long shutdown, a new tracking layer, known as the insertable B-layer  [45] , was added at a radius of 33 mm. High-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity range j η j  <  3 . 2 . The hadronic calorimetry in the range  j η j  <  1 . 7  is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, consisting of a large barrel and two smaller extended barrel cylinders, one on either side of the central barrel. In the endcaps ( j η j  >  1 . 5 ), copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr hadronic calorimeters match the outer  j η j  limits of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters. The LAr forward calorimeters provide both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements, and extend the coverage to  j η j  <  4 . 9 . The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muons in the magnetic field provided by large superconducting air-core toroid magnets in the pseudorapidity range  j η j  <  2 . 7 , instrumented with separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers. Over most of the  η range, a measurement of the track coordinates in the bending direction of the magnetic field is provided by monitored drift tubes. Cathode strip chambers with higher granularity are used in the innermost plane over 2 . 0  <  j η j  <  2 . 7 . The muon fast trigger detectors cover the pseudorapidity range  j η j  <  2 . 4  and provide a measurement of the coordinate in the nonbending plane. The data were collected using an online two-level trigger system  [46]  that selects events of interest and reduces the event rate from several MHz to about 1 kHz for recording and offline processing. III. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to compute detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies, determine signal and background contributions, and estimate systematic uncertainties in the final results. Background contributions from multijet processes are determined directly from data. A. Background simulation The expected background to the monojetlike signature is dominated by  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets and  W  þ  jets production with  W ð →  τν Þ þ  jets being the largest  W  þ  jets background, and includes small contributions from  Z= γ ð → l l Þ þ  jets ( l  ¼  e ,  μ ,  τ ), multijet,  t ¯ t , single-top, and diboson ( WW; WZ; ZZ ) processes. Contributions from top production associated with additional vector bosons ( t ¯ t  þ  W ,  t ¯ t  þ  Z , or  t  þ  Z  þ  q=b  processes) are negligible. Events containing  W  or  Z  bosons with associated jets are simulated using the  [47]  generator. Matrix elements (ME) are calculated for up to two partons at nextto-leading order (NLO) and four partons at leading order (LO) using the  [48]  and  [49]  matrix element generators and merged with the  parton shower (PS)  [50]  using the ME  þ  PS@NLO prescription [51] . The CT10  [52]  parton distribution function (PDF) set is used in conjunction with a dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the authors of . The MC predictions are initially normalized to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions according to DYNNLO [53,54] using MSTW2008 90% C.L. NNLO PDF sets  [55] . For the generation of  t ¯ t  and single top quarks in the  Wt channel and  s  channel the  [56]  generator with the CT10 PDF sets in the matrix element calculations is used. Electroweak  t -channel single top-quark events are generated using the  generator. This generator uses the four-flavor scheme for the calculations of NLO matrix elements with the fixed four-flavor PDF set CT10. The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event are simulated using  [57]  with the CTEQ6L1  [58]  PDF sets and the corresponding Perugia 2012 set of tuned parameters (P2012 tune)  [59] . The topquark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The  program [60]  is used to model the decays of the bottom and charm hadrons. Finally, diboson samples ( WW ,  WZ , and  ZZ production) are generated using  with CT10 PDFs and are normalized to NLO pQCD predictions  [61] . The diboson samples are also generated using interfaced to  and using CT10 PDFs for studies of systematic uncertainties. B. Signal simulation Simulated samples for the ADD LED model with different numbers of extra dimensions in the range n  ¼  2 – 6  and  M  in the range 2 – 5 TeV are generated using  with NNPDF23LO  [62]  PDFs. The renormalization scale is set to the geometric mean of the transverse mass of the two produced particles, ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð p þ  m Þð p þ  m Þ q , where  m  and  p  ( m  and p ) denote, respectively, the mass and the transverse momentum of the graviton (parton) in the final state. The factorization scale is set to the minimum transverse mass ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ m þ  p p of the graviton and the parton. SUSY signals for stop pair production with ~ t  →  c  þ  ~ χ , for sbottom pair production decaying as ~ b  →  b  þ  ~ χ , and for the production of squark pairs from the first two squark generations with  ~ q  →  q  þ  ~ χ ( q  ¼  u ,  d ,  c ,  s ) are considered. Events are generated with _  [63] interfaced to  with the ATLAS A14  [64]  tune for the modeling of the squark decay, and the parton showering, hadronization, and underlying event. The matrix element calculation is performed at tree level, and includes the emission of up to two additional partons. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to the sum of transverse masses of all final state particles. The PDF used for the generation is NNPDF23LO. The ME-PS matching is done using the CKKW-L  [65]  prescription, with a matching scale set to one quarter of the pair-produced superpartner mass. Simulated samples with squark masses in the range between 250 and 700 GeV and  Δ m  varying between 5 and 25 GeVare produced. Signal cross sections are calculated to NLO in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLO  þ  NLL) accuracy  [66 – 68] . The nominal cross section and its uncertainty are taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in Ref.  [69] . WIMP signals are simulated in [70 – 72] using revision 3049 of the DMV model implementation of WIMP pair production with  s -channel spin-1 mediator exchange at NLO precision including parton showering effects, introduced in Ref. [73] . Renormalization and factorization scales are set to  H = 2 on an event-by-event basis, where  H  ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ m  þ  p q þ p  is defined by the invariant mass of the WIMP pair ( m ) and the transverse momentum of the hardest jet ( p ). A Breit-Wigner distribution is chosen to describe the mediator propagator. Events are generated using the NNPDF30NLO  [74]  parton distribution functions and interfaced to  with the ATLAS A14 tune for parton showering. Couplings of the mediator to WIMPs and quarks are set to  g  ¼  1  and  g  ¼  1 = 4 , leading to narrow mediators with  Γ =m  up to about 5%. A grid of samples is produced for WIMP masses ranging from 1 GeV to 1 TeVand mediator masses between 10 GeVand 2 TeV. Differing pileup (multiple proton-proton interactions in the same or neighboring bunch crossings) conditions as a function of the instantaneous luminosity are taken into account by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events generated with  onto the hard-scattering process. The MC-generated samples are processed with a full ATLAS detector simulation  [75]  based on the program  [76] . The simulated events are reconstructed and analyzed with the same analysis chain as for the data, using the same trigger and event selection criteria. IV. RECONSTRUCTION OF PHYSICS OBJECTS Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters using the antik  jet algorithm  [77]  with the radius parameter (in  y – ϕ  space) set to 0.4. The measured jet transverse momentum is corrected for detector effects, including the noncompensating character of the calorimeter, by weighting energy deposits arising from electromagnetic and hadronic showers differently. In addition, jets are corrected for contributions from pileup, as described in Ref.  [78] . Jets with corrected  p  >  20  GeV and  j η j  <  2 . 8 are initially considered in the analysis. Track-based variables to suppress pileup jets have been developed. A combination of two such variables called the jet-vertex tagger is constructed. In order to remove jets originating from pileup collisions, for central jets ( j η j  <  2 . 4 ) with  p  < 50  GeV a significant fraction of the tracks associated with each jet must have an origin compatible with the primary vertex, as defined by the jet-vertex tagger  [79] . The presence of leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state is used in the analysis to define control samples and to reject background contributions in the signal regions (see Secs.  V and  VI ). Electron candidates are initially required to have  p  >  20  GeV and  j η j  <  2 . 47 , and to satisfy the loose electron shower shape and track selection criteria described in Refs.  [80,81] . Overlaps between identified electrons and jets in the final state are resolved. Jets are discarded if their separation  Δ R  ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð Δ η Þ þ ð Δ ϕ Þ p from an identified electron is less than 0.2. The electrons separated by  Δ R between 0.2 and 0.4 from any remaining jet are removed. Muon candidates are formed by combining information from the muon spectrometer and inner tracking detectors as described in Ref.  [80]  and are required to have  p  > 10  GeV and  j η j  <  2 . 5 . Jets with  p  >  20  GeV and less than three tracks with  p  >  0 . 4  GeV associated with them are discarded if their separation  Δ R  from an identified muon is less than 0.4. The muon is discarded if it is matched to a jet that has at least three tracks associated with it. The  E is reconstructed using all energy deposits in the calorimeter up to pseudorapidity  j η j ¼  4 . 9 . Clusters associated with either electrons or photons with  p  >  20  GeV and those associated with jets with  p  >  20  GeV make use of the corresponding calibrations for these objects. Softer jets and clusters not associated with these objects are calibrated using tracking information  [82] . As discussed below, in this analysis the  E is not corrected for the presence of muons in the final state. V. EVENT SELECTION The data sample considered in this paper was collected with tracking detectors, calorimeters, muon chambers, and magnets fully operational, and corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of  3 . 2  fb . The data were selected online using a trigger logic that selects events with  E above 70 GeV, as computed at the final stage of the twolevel trigger system of ATLAS. With the final analysis requirements, the trigger selection is fully efficient for E >  250  GeV, as determined using a data sample with muons in the final state. The following selection criteria, summarized in Table  I , are applied in the signal regions. (i) Events are required to have a reconstructed primary vertex for the interaction with at least two associated tracks with  p  >  0 . 4  GeV and consistent with the beamspot envelope; when more than one such vertex is found, the vertex with the largest summed  p of the associated tracks is chosen. (ii) Events are required to have  E >  250  GeV. The analysis selects events with a leading (highest  p ) jet with  p  >  250  GeV and  j η j  <  2 . 4  in the final state. A maximum of four jets with  p  >  30  GeV and j η j  <  2 . 8  are allowed. A separation in the azimuthal plane of  Δ ϕ ð jet ; ~p Þ  >  0 . 4  between the missing transverse momentum direction and each selected jet is required. This requirement reduces the multijet background contribution where the large  E originates mainly from jet energy mismeasurement. (iii) Events are rejected if they contain any jet inconsistent with the requirement that they originate from a proton-proton collision. Jet quality selection criteria  [83]  involve quantities such as the pulse shape of the energy depositions in the cells of the calorimeters, electromagnetic fraction in the calorimeter, calorimeter sampling fraction, or charged-particle fraction. The loose criteria are applied to all jets with  p  >  20  GeV and  j η j  <  2 . 8 , dealing efficiently with coherent noise and electronic noise bursts in the calorimeter producing anomalous energy depositions [84] . Noncollision backgrounds, i.e. energy depositions in the calorimeters due to muons of beaminduced or cosmic-ray origin, are further suppressed by applying the tight selection criteria to the leading jet: the ratio of the jet charged-particle fraction to the calorimeter sampling fraction, f =f , is required to be larger than 0.1. These requirements have a negligible effect on the signal efficiency. (iv) Events with identified muons with  p  >  10  GeV or electrons with  p  >  20  GeV in the final state are vetoed. Inclusive (IM1 – IM7) and exclusive (EM1 – EM6) signal regions are considered with increasing  E thresholds from 250 to 700 GeV (see Table  I ). The use of inclusive E signal regions follows the Run 1 strategy, where the results are translated into model-independent cross section upper limits for the production of new physics. The use of exclusive  E signal regions effectively explores information from the shape of the  E distribution (see Secs.  VI D and  VIII ) and enhances the sensitivity to the different new physics models. VI. BACKGROUND ESTIMATION The  W  þ  jets,  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets,  Z= γ ð →  τ τ Þ þ  jets, and  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets backgrounds are constrained using MC samples normalized with data in selected control regions. The normalization factors are extracted simultaneously using a global fit that includes systematic uncertainties, to properly take into account correlations. A  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets control sample is used to define normalization factors for  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets and  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ jets processes. As discussed in Sec.  VI D , the use of the W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets control sample to constrain the normalization of the  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets process translates into a reduced uncertainty in the estimation of the main irreducible background contribution, due to a partial cancellation of systematic uncertainties and the statistical power of the W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets control sample in data, which is about seven times larger than the  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets control sample. A  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets control sample is used to constrain the normalization of the  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets and W ð →  τν Þ þ  jets background processes. For the latter, this is motivated by the fact that the  τ  lepton in the  W ð →  τν Þ þ jets background process mainly decays hadronically leading to a final-state topology in the detector similar to that of the  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets sample. A small  Z= γ ð →  τ τ Þ þ  jets background contribution is also constrained using the  W ð → e ν Þ þ  jets control sample. Uncertainties related to the difference between  W  þ  jets and  Z  þ  jets final states, leading to potential differences in event kinematics and selection acceptances and efficiencies, are discussed in Sec.  VII . Finally, a  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets control sample is used to constrain the  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets background contribution. The remaining SM backgrounds from  Z= γ ð →  e e Þ þ  jets, t ¯ t , single top, and dibosons are determined using MC simulated samples, while the multijet background contribution is extracted from data. The contributions from noncollision backgrounds are estimated in data using the beam-induced background identification techniques described in Ref.  [84] . The methodology and the samples used for estimating the background are summarized in Table  II . In the following subsections, details of the definition of the  W=Z  þ  jets control regions and of the data-driven determination of the multijet and beam-induced backgrounds are given. This is followed by a description of the background fits. A.  W = Z  þ  jets  background Control samples in data, with identified electrons or muons in the final state and with requirements on the jet  p  and  E identical to those in the signal regions, are used to determine the  W ð →  l ν Þ þ  jets ( l  ¼  e ,  μ ,  τ ), Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets, and  Z= γ ð →  l l Þ þ  jets ( l  ¼  μ ,  τ ) background contributions. The  Z= γ ð →  e e Þ þ  jets background contribution is tiny and it is determined from MC simulation. The  E -based online trigger used in the analysis does not include muon information in the  E calculation. This allows the collection of  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets and  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets control samples with the same trigger as for the signal regions. A  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets control sample is selected by requiring a muon consistent with originating from the primary vertex with  p  >  10  GeV, and transverse mass in the range 30  GeV  < m  <  100  GeV. The transverse mass  m  ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 p p ½ 1  −  cos ð ϕ  −  ϕ Þ� p is defined by the lepton and neutrino transverse momenta, where the  ð x; y Þ  components of the neutrino momentum are taken to be the same as the corresponding  ~p components. Events with identified electrons in the final state are vetoed. Similarly, a  Z= γ ð → μ μ Þ þ  jets control sample is selected by requiring the presence of two muons with  p  >  10  GeV and invariant mass in the range  66  GeV  < m  <  116  GeV. In the  W ð → μν Þ þ  jets and  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets control regions, the E is not corrected for the presence of the muons in the final state, motivated by the fact that these control regions are used to estimate the  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets and the  Z= γ ð → μ μ Þ þ  jets backgrounds, respectively, in the signal regions with no identified muons. Finally, a  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets dominated control sample is defined with an isolated electron candidate with p  >  20  GeV, selected with tight or medium selection criteria  [80,81]  depending on  p , and no additional identified leptons in the final state. The  E calculation includes the contribution of the energy cluster from the identified electron in the calorimeter (no attempt is made to subtract it), since  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets processes contribute to the background in the signal regions when the electron is not identified. Monte Carlo based scale factors, determined from the  simulation, are defined for each of the signal selections to estimate the different background contributions in the signal regions. As an illustration, in the case of the dominant  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets background process itscontributiontoagivensignalregion N isdetermined usingthe W ð →  μν Þ þ  jetscontrolsampleindataaccordingto N ¼ð N − N Þ × N N ; ð 2 Þ where  N denotes the background predicted by the MC simulation in the signal region, and  N , N , and  N denote, in the control region, the number of data events, the number of  W ð → μν Þ þ  jets candidates from MC simulation, and the nonW ð →  μν Þ background contribution, respectively. The N term refers mainly to top-quark and diboson processes,butalsoincludescontributionsfromother W=Z  þ jetsprocesses.Multijetsandnoncollisionbackgroundsinthe control regions are negligible. As discussed in Sec.  VI D , a global simultaneous likelihood fit to all the control regions is used to determine the normalization factors. B. Multijets background The multijet background with large  E mainly originates from the misreconstruction of the energy of a jet in the calorimeter and to a lesser extent is due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state from heavy-flavor hadron decays. In this analysis, the multijet background is determined from data, using the jet smearing method as described in Ref.  [85] , which relies on the assumption that the  E of multijet events is dominated by fluctuations in the jet response in the detector which can be measured in the data. For the IM1 and EM1 selections, the multijets background constitutes about 0.5% of the total background, and is negligible for the other signal regions. C. Noncollision background Noncollision backgrounds represent a significant portion of data acquired by  E triggers. These backgrounds resemble the topology of monojetlike final states and a dedicated strategy with a suppression power of approximately  10 is needed in order to reduce these backgrounds to a subpercent level. This is achieved by the jet quality selection criteria described in Sec.  V . The rate of jets due to cosmic-ray muons surviving this selection, as measured in dedicated cosmic ray data sets, is found to be negligible compared to the rate of data in the monojetlike signal regions. The main source of residual noncollision backgrounds is therefore beaminduced muons originating in the particle cascades due to beam halo protons intercepting the LHC collimators. The noncollision background is estimated using a method that identifies beam-induced muons based on the spatial matching of calorimeter clusters to muon track segments, reconstructed in the muon-system endcaps and pointing in a direction nearly parallel to the beam pipe  [84] . The number of events where the reconstructed objects satisfy the identification criteria is corrected for the efficiency of this method. The efficiency is evaluated in a dedicated beam-induced background-enhanced region defined by inverting the tight jet quality selection imposed on the leading jet. The results indicate an almost negligible contribution from noncollision backgrounds in the signal regions. As an example, 110 and 19 noncollision background events are estimated in the IM1 and EM3 signal regions, respectively, with no sign of noncollision backgrounds at E >  500  GeV. This constitutes about 0.5% of the total background for the IM1 and EM3 selections. D. Background fits The use of control regions to constrain the normalization of the dominant background contributions from  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ jets and  W  þ  jets significantly reduces the relatively large theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties, of the order of 20% – 40%, associated with purely MC-based background predictions in the signal regions. A complete study of systematic uncertainties is carried out, as detailed in Sec.  VII . To determine the final uncertainty in the total background, all systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with Gaussian shapes in a fit based on the profile likelihood method  [86]  and which takes into account correlations among systematic variations. The likelihood also takes into account cross-contamination between different background sources in the control regions. A simultaneous likelihood fit to the  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets, W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets, and  Z= γ ð →  μ μ Þ þ  jets control regions is performed to normalize and constrain the corresponding background estimates in the signal regions. Backgroundonly fits are performed separately in each of the inclusive regions IM1 – IM7, as described in Sec.  V . In addition, a fit simultaneously using all the exclusive  E regions EM1 – EM6 and IM7 is performed. In this case, normalization factors are considered separately in each exclusive  E region, which effectively employs information from the shape of the  E distribution to enhance the sensitivity of the analysis to the presence of new phenomena. The results of the background-only fit in the control regions are presented in detail in Table  III  for the IM1 selection. Tables  IV – VI  collect the results for the total background predictions in each of the control regions for the inclusive and exclusive  E selections. As the tables indicate, the  W=Z  þ  jets background predictions receive multiplicative normalization factors that vary in the range between 0.8 and 1.2, depending on the process and the kinematic selection. Good agreement is observed between the normalization factors obtained by using inclusive or exclusive  E regions. Figure  2  shows, for the IM1 monojetlike kinematic selection and in the different control regions, the distributions of the  E and the leading-jet  p  in data and MC simulation. The MC predictions include data-driven normalization factors as extracted from the global fit that considers exclusive  E bins. Altogether, the MC simulation provides a good description of the shape of the measured distributions in the different control regions. In the analysis, the control regions are defined using the same requirements for  E , leading jet  p , event topologies, and jet vetoes as in the signal regions, such that no extrapolation in  E or jet  p  is needed from control to signal regions. Agreement between data and background predictions is confirmed in a lowp  validation region defined using the same monojetlike selection criteria with E limited to the range 150 – 250 GeV. VII. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES In this section the impact of each source of systematic uncertainty on the total background prediction in the signal regions, as determined via the global fits explained in Sec.  VI D , is discussed. Here, the case of the inclusive  E selections is presented. Similar studies are carried out in exclusive  E bins. The correlation of systematic uncertainties across  E bins is properly taken into account. Finally, the experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the signal yields are discussed. A. Background systematic uncertainties Uncertainties in the absolute jet and  E energy scales and resolutions  [78]  translate into an uncertainty in the total background which varies between  � 0 . 5%  for IM1 and � 1 . 6%  for IM7. Uncertainties related to jet quality requirements, pileup description and corrections to the jet  p  and E introduce a  � 0 . 2%  to  � 0 . 9%  uncertainty in the background predictions. Uncertainties in the simulated lepton identification and reconstruction efficiencies, energy/momentum scale and resolution translate into an uncertainty in the total background which varies between � 0 . 1%  and  � 1 . 4%  for the IM1 and between  � 0 . 1%  and � 2 . 6%  for the IM7 selections, respectively. Variations of the renormalization, factorization, and parton-shower matching scales and PDFs in the W=Z  þ  jets background samples translate into a  � 1 . 1%  to � 1 . 3%  uncertainty in the total background. Model uncertainties, related to potential differences between  W  þ  jets and  Z  þ  jets final states, affecting the normalization of the dominant  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets background and the small Z= γ ð →  τ τ Þ þ  jets background contribution as determined in  W ð →  μν Þ þ  jets and  W ð →  e ν Þ þ  jets control regions, are studied in detail. This includes uncertainties related to PDFs and renormalization and factorization scale settings, the parton-shower parameters and the hadronization model used in the MC simulation, and the dependence on the lepton reconstruction and acceptance. As a result, an additional  � 3%  uncertainty in the  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets and Z= γ ð →  τ τ Þ þ  jets contributions is included for all the selections. In addition, the effect from NLO electroweak corrections on the  W  þ  jets to  Z  þ  jets ratio is taken into account  [87 – 89] . Dedicated parton-level calculations are performed with the same  E and leading-jetp  requirements as in the IM1 – IM7 signal regions. The studies suggest an effect on the  W  þ  jets to  Z  þ  jets ratio which varies between about  � 1 . 9%  for IM1 and  � 5 . 2%  for IM7, although the calculations suffer from large uncertainties, mainly due to our limited knowledge of the photon PDFs in the proton. In this analysis, these results are adopted as an additional uncertainty in the  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets and  Z= γ ð → τ τ Þ þ  jets contributions. Altogether, this translates into an uncertainty in the total background which varies from � 2 . 0%  and  � 3 . 0%  for the IM1 and IM5 selections, respectively, to about  � 3 . 9%  for the IM7 selection. Theoretical uncertainties in the predicted background yields for top-quark-related processes include uncertainties on the absolute  t ¯ t  and single-top production cross sections; variations in the set of parameters that govern the parton showers and the amount of initialand final-state soft gluon radiation; and uncertainties due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales and PDFs. This introduces an uncertainty in the total background prediction which varies between  � 2 . 7%  and  � 3 . 3%  for the IM1 and IM7 selections, respectively. Uncertainties in the diboson contribution are estimated using different MC generators and translate into an uncertainty in the total background in the range between  � 0 . 05%  and  � 0 . 4% . A  �  100%  uncertainty in the multijet and noncollision background estimations is adopted, leading to a  � 0 . 2%  uncertainty in the total background for the IM1 selection. Statistical uncertainties related to the data control regions and simulation samples lead to an additional uncertainty in the final background estimates in the signal regions which varies between � 2 . 5%  for the IM1 and  � 10%  for the IM7 selections. Finally, the impact of the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity, which partially cancels in the data-driven determination of the SM background, is negligible. B. Signal systematic uncertainties Several sources of systematic uncertainty in the predicted signal yields are considered for each of the models of new physics. The uncertainties are computed separately for each signal region by varying the model parameters (see Sec.  VIII ). Experimental uncertainties include those related to the jet and  E reconstruction, energy scales and resolutions; and the  � 5%  uncertainty in the integrated luminosity, derived following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref.  [90] , from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x – y  beam-separation scans performed in August 2015. Other uncertainties related to the jet quality requirements are negligible ( <  1% ). Uncertaintiesaffectingthesignalacceptance,relatedtothe generation of the signal samples, include uncertainties in the modeling of the initialand final-state gluon radiation, as determined using simulated samples with modified partonshowerparameters(byfactorsoftwooronehalf)thatenhance orsuppressthepartonradiation;uncertaintiesduetoPDFand variations of the  α ð m Þ  value employed, as computed from theenvelopeofCT10,MMHT2014 [91] andNNPDF30error sets; and the choice of renormalization and factorization scales. In addition, theoretical uncertainties in the predicted cross sections, including PDF and renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties, are computed separately for the different models. VIII. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION The number of events in data and the expected background predictions in several inclusive and exclusive signal regions, as determined using the global fit discussed in Sec.  VI D , are presented in detail in Table  VII . The results for all the signal regions are summarized in Table  VIII . Good agreement is observed between the data and the SM predictions in each case. The SM predictions for the inclusive selections are determined with a total uncertainty of  � 4 . 0% ,  � 6 . 8% , and  � 12%  for the IM1, IM5, and IM7 signal regions, respectively, which include correlations between uncertainties in the individual background contributions. Figure  3  shows several measured distributions compared to the SM predictions for  E >  250  GeV, for which the normalization factors applied to the MC predictions, and the related uncertainties, are determined from the global fit carried out in exclusive  E bins. For illustration purposes, the distributions include the impact of different ADD, SUSY, and WIMP scenarios. The level of agreement between the data and the SM predictions for the total number of events in the different inclusive signal regions IM1 – IM7 is translated into upper limits for the presence of new phenomena. A simultaneous likelihood fit is performed in both the control and signal regions, separately for each of the inclusive regions IM1 – IM7. As a result, model-independent 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits on the visible cross section, defined as the production cross section times acceptance times efficiency  σ  ×  A  ×  ϵ , are extracted using the  CL  modified frequentist approach  [92]  and considering the systematic uncertainties in the SM backgrounds and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The results are presented in Table  IX . Values of  σ  ×  A  ×  ϵ  above 553 fb (for IM1) and above 19 fb (for IM7) are excluded at 95% C.L. Typical event selection efficiencies  ϵ  varying from about 100% for IM1 to 96% for IM7 are found in simulated  Z ð →  ν ¯ ν Þ þ  jets background processes. A. Large extra spatial dimensions The level of agreement between the data and the SM predictions is translated into limits on the parameters of the ADD model. Only the signal regions with E >  400  GeV, where the SM background is moderate and the shape difference between signal and the SM background becomes apparent, have an impact on the ADD limits. The typical  A  ×  ϵ  of the selection criteria varies, as the number of extra dimensions  n  increases from n  ¼  2  to  n  ¼  6 , between 5.5% and 6.6% for IM4 and between 2.9% and 4.2% for IM7. The experimental uncertainties related to the jet and  E scales and resolutions introduce uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between  � 1%  and  � 3% . The uncertainties related to the modeling of the initialand final-state gluon radiation translate into uncertainties in the ADD signal acceptance which vary between  � 7%  and  � 10% . The uncertainties due to the PDFs, affecting the predicted signal cross sections, increase from  � 16%  at  n  ¼  2  to � 42%  at  n  ¼  6 . The effect of PDF uncertainties on the acceptance is between  � 10%  and  � 20% , mildly increasing with increasing  n  and  E . Similarly, the variations of the renormalization and factorization scales introduce a  � 23% to  � 36%  uncertainty in the signal yields, with increasing  n and  E requirements, and about a  � 10%  variation in the signal acceptance. Observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusion limits are set on  M  as a function of  n  using the  CL  approach, for which a simultaneous fit to the signal and control regions in the exclusive  E bins is performed, including statistical and systematic uncertainties. Uncertainties in the signal acceptance times efficiency, the background predictions, and the luminosity are considered, and correlations between systematic uncertainties in signal and background predictions are taken into account. The fit accounts for the contamination of the control regions by signal events which  a priori is estimated to be very small. In addition, observed limits are computed using  � 1 σ  variations of the theoretical predictions for the ADD cross sections. The  − 1 σ  variations of the ADD theoretical cross sections result in about a 6% decrease in the nominal observed limits. Figure  4  and Table  X  present the results in the case of the ADD model. Values of  M  below 6.58 TeVat  n  ¼  2  and below 4.31 TeV at  n  ¼  6  are excluded at 95% C.L., which extend the exclusion from previous results using 8 TeV data  [37] . As discussed in Refs.  [5,37] , the analysis partially probes the phase-space region with  ˆ s > M , where ﬃﬃﬃ ˆ s p is the center-of-mass energy of the hard interaction. This challenges the validity of model implementation and the lower bounds on  M , as they depend on the unknown ultraviolet behavior of the effective theory. The observed 95% C.L. limits are recomputed after suppressing, with a weighting factor  M = ˆ s , the signal events with  ˆ s > M , here referred to as damping. This results in a decrease of the quoted 95% C.L. lower limit on  M  which is negligible for  n  ¼  2 and about 5% for  n  ¼  6 . B. Squark pair production The results are translated into exclusion limits computed separately for stop pair production with ~ t  →  c  þ  ~ χ , squark pair production with  ~ q  →  q  þ  ~ χ ( q  ¼  u ,  d ,  c ,  s ), and sbottom pair production with ~ b  →  b  þ  ~ χ , as a function of the squark mass for different neutralino masses. As an example, in the case of stop pair production the typical  A  ×  ϵ  of the selection criteria varies, with increasing stop and neutralino masses, between 0.7% and 1.4% for IM1 and between 0.06% and 0.8% for IM7. Observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusion limits are calculated using a simultaneous fit to the signal and control regions in exclusive  E bins, as in the case of the ADD models. The systematic uncertainties in the SUSY signal yields are also determined following a procedure close to that for the ADD case. The uncertainties related to the jet and  E scales and resolutions introduce uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between  � 0 . 2%  and  � 7%  for different selections and squark and neutralino masses. In addition, the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is included. The uncertainties related to the modeling of initialand finalstate gluon radiation translate into a  � 7%  to  � 17% uncertainty in the signal yields. The uncertainties due to the PDFs result in a  � 5%  to  � 17%  uncertainty in the signal yields. Finally, the variations of the renormalization and factorization scales introduce a  � 4%  to  � 13%  uncertainty in the signal yields. Figure  5  presents the results in the case of the ~ t  → c  þ  ~ χ signal. The previous limits from the ATLAS Collaboration  [10]  are also shown. As anticipated, the monojetlike selection improves significantly the sensitivity at very low  Δ m . In the compressed scenario with the stop and neutralino nearly degenerate in mass, the exclusion extends up to stop masses of 323 GeV. The region with Δ m <  5  GeV is not considered in the exclusion since in this regime the stop could become long lived. Figure  6 (left) presents the observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusion limits as a function of the sbottom mass and the sbottom-neutralino mass difference for the ~ b  →  b  þ  ~ χ decay channel. In the scenario with  m  −  m ∼  m , this analysis extends the 95% C.L. exclusion limits up to a sbottom mass of 323 GeV. Similarly, Fig.  6  (right) presents the observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusion limits as a function of the squark mass and the squark-neutralino mass difference for  ~ q  →  q  þ  ~ χ ( q  ¼  u ,  d ,  c ,  s ). In the compressed scenario with similar squark and neutralino masses, squark masses below 608 GeV are excluded at 95% C.L. These results significantly extend previous exclusion limits  [10,93,94] . C. Weakly interacting massive particles The results are translated into exclusion limits on the WIMP pair production, assuming the exchange of an axialvector mediator in the  s -channel. For on-shell WIMP pair production, where  m  >  2 m , typical  A  ×  ϵ  values for the signal models with a 1 TeV mediator range from 25% to 2% for IM1 and IM7 selections, respectively. The effect of experimental uncertainties related to jet and E scales and resolutions is found to be similar to the effect in the ADD model. The uncertainty related to the modeling of the initialand final-state radiation translates into  � 20%  uncertainty in the acceptance and is neglected for the cross section. The choice of different PDF sets results in up to  � 20%  uncertainty in the acceptance and � 10%  uncertainty in the cross section. Varying the renormalization and factorization scales introduces  � 5% variations of the cross section and a  � 3%  change in the acceptance. In addition, the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is included. Figure  7  (left) shows the observed and expected 95% C.L. exclusion limits in the  m – m  parameter plane for a simplified model with an axial-vector mediator, Dirac WIMPs, and couplings  g  ¼  1 = 4  and  g  ¼  1 . A minimal mediator width is assumed. In addition, observed limits are shown using  � 1 σ  theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross sections. In the on-shell regime, the models with mediator masses up to 1 TeV are excluded. This analysis loses sensitivity to the models in the off-shell regime, where the decay into a pair of WIMPs is kinematically suppressed. The perturbative unitarity is violated in the parameter region defined by  m  > ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ π = 2 p m  [95] . The masses corresponding to the correct relic density as measured by the Planck and WMAP satellites  [35,36] , in the absence of any interaction other than the one considered, are indicated in the figure as a line that crosses the excluded region at  m  ∼ 880  GeV and  m  ∼  270  GeV. The region towards lower WIMP masses or higher mediator masses corresponds to dark matter overproduction. On the opposite side of the curve, other WIMP production mechanisms need to exist in order to explain the observed dark matter relic density. In Fig.  7  (right) the results are translated into 90% C.L. exclusion limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton scattering cross section as a function of the WIMP mass, following the prescriptions explained in Refs.  [41,42] , and are compared to results from the direct-detection experiments XENON100  [96] , LUX  [97] , and PICO  [98,99] . This comparison is model dependent and solely valid in the context of this particular  Z -like model. In this case, stringent limits on the scattering cross section of the order of  10 cm up to WIMP masses of about 300 GeV are inferred from this analysis, and complement the results from direct-detection experiments for  m  <  10  GeV. The loss of sensitivity in models where WIMPs are produced off-shell is expressed by the turn of the exclusion line, reaching back to low WIMP masses and intercepting the exclusion lines from the direct-detection experiments at around  m  ¼  80  GeV. IX. CONCLUSIONS In summary, results are reported from a search for new phenomena in events with an energetic jet and large missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at ﬃﬃﬃ s p ¼  13  TeV at the LHC, based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  3 . 2  fb collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015. The measurements are in agreement with the SM predictions. The results are translated into model-independent 95% confidence-level upper limits on  σ  ×  A  ×  ϵ  in the range 553 – 19 fb, depending on the selection criteria considered. The results are presented in terms of lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale,  M , versus the number of extra spatial dimensions in the ADD LED model. Values of  M below 6.58 TeV at  n  ¼  2  and below 4.31 TeV at  n  ¼  6  are excluded at 95% C.L. Similarly, the results are interpreted in terms of the search for squark pair production in a compressed supersymmetric scenario. In the case of stop and sbottom pair production with ~ t  →  c  þ  ~ χ and ~ b  →  b  þ  ~ χ , respectively, squark masses below 323 GeV are excluded at 95% C.L. In the case of squark pair production with  ~ q  →  q  þ  ~ χ ð q  ¼  u; d; c; s Þ  squark masses below 608 GeV are excluded. Altogether, these results extend the exclusion from previous analyses at the LHC. Finally, the results are interpreted in terms of upper limits on the pair-production cross section of WIMPs. A simplified model is used with an axial-vector mediator, given couplings to fermions  g  ¼  1  and  g  ¼  1 = 4 , and considering Dirac fermions as dark matter candidates. Mediator masses below 1 TeV are excluded at 95% C.L. for WIMP masses below 250 GeV. These results are translated, in a model-dependent manner, into upper limits on spindependent contributions to the WIMP-nucleon elastic cross section as a function of the WIMP mass. WIMP-proton cross sections above  10 cm are excluded at 90% C.L. for WIMP masses below 10 GeV, complementing results from direct-detection experiments.
