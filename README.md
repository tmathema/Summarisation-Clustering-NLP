Text Summarisation of UCT publications using deep learning

This project explored the application of deep learning summarisation methods, clustering and
social network techniques to organise research output for better accessibility. Two pre-trained deep learning models known as Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) were used on a corpus of full text research publications from the University of Cape Town were employed for the summarisation task. While Spectral and HDBScan (Hierarchical Density-based spatial clustering) clustering models were applied to generate summaries to obtain clusters of similar publications. Finally, using information from the clusters, an academic social network of authors was created to show how authors were connected.
